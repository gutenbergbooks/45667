<h1 title="">THE BOY SCOUTS
<br />ALONG THE SUSQUEHANNA.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE TRAMP CHASE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no weather sharp, boys; but all the same
I want to remark that it&rsquo;s going to rain like cats
and dogs before a great while. Put a pin in that
to remember it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say so, Davy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just when we&rsquo;re getting along splendidly,
with the old Susquehanna not a great ways off,
you have to go and put a damper on everything.
Tell us how you know all that, won&rsquo;t you, Davy
Jones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will, Giraffe, with the greatest of pleasure,
while we&rsquo;re sitting here on this log, resting
up. In the first place just notice how gray the
sky&rsquo;s gotten since we had that snack at the farm
house about noon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! shucks! that&rsquo;s no positive sign; it often
clouds up, and never a drop falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be quite some drops come
<i>this</i> time, and don&rsquo;t you forget it, Step Hen.
Why, can&rsquo;t you feel the dampness in the air?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That brings it a little closer home, Davy; any
more reasons?&rdquo; demanded the boy answering to
the singular name of &ldquo;Step Hen,&rdquo; but who, under
other conditions, would have come just as quickly
if someone had shouted &ldquo;Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was smart enough to look up the
weather predictions before we left Cranford yesterday,&rdquo;
replied the active boy whom they called
Davy, as he laughed softly to himself; &ldquo;and they
said heavy rains coming all along the line from
out West; and that they ought to hit us here by
to-night, unless held up on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! is that so? I guess you&rsquo;ve made out
your case, then, Davy,&rdquo; admitted the boy called
&ldquo;Giraffe,&rdquo; possibly on account of his unusually
long neck, which he had a habit of stretching on
occasion to abnormal dimensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe Thad knew about what was in the air
when he told us to fetch our rubber ponchos along
this trip,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen, whose last name
was Bingham.</p>
<p>There were just eight boys in khaki sprawled
along that log in various favorite positions suggestive
of comfort. They constituted the full membership
of the Silver Fox Patrol connected with the
Cranford Troop of Boy Scouts, and the one designated
as Thad Brewster had been the leader ever
since the start of the organization.</p>
<p>Those of our readers who have been fortunate
enough to possess any of the previous volumes in
this Series need not be told just who these enterprising
lads are; but for the purpose of introducing
them to newcomers, a few words may be
deemed necessary in the start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Besides the patrol leader there were Allan Hollister,
a boy whose former experiences in the woods
of Maine and the Adirondacks made him an authority
on subjects connected with outdoor life; a
Southern boy, Robert Quail White, called &ldquo;Bob
White&rdquo; by all his chums; Conrad Stedman, otherwise
the &ldquo;Giraffe,&rdquo; previously mentioned; &ldquo;Step
Hen&rdquo; Bingham; Davy Jones, an uneasy fellow,
whose great specialty seemed to lie in the way of
wonderful gymnastic feats, such as walking on his
hands, hanging by his toes from a lofty limb, and
kindred remarkable reckless habits; Cornelius Hawtree,
a very red-faced, stout youth, with fiery hair
and a mild disposition, and known as &ldquo;Bumpus&rdquo;
among his set; and last though not least &ldquo;Smithy,&rdquo;
whose real name was Edmund Maurice Travers
Smith, and who had never fully overcome his
dainty habits that at first had made him a subject
of ridicule among the more rough-and-ready
members of the Silver Fox Patrol.</p>
<p>There they were, as active a lot of scouts as
could have been found from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. They had been through considerable in
the way of seeing life; and yet their experiences
had not spoiled them in the least.</p>
<p>At the time we discover them seated on that
big log they were a good many miles away from
their home town; and seemed to be bent upon
some object that might make their Easter holidays
a season to be long remembered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>When Step Hen so naively hinted that the patrol
leader may have suspected a spell of bad
weather was due, when he ordered them to be sure
and fetch along their rubber ponchos, there was a
craning of necks, as everybody tried to set eyes
on the face of Thad. Of course Giraffe had the
advantage here, on account of that long neck of
his, which he often thrust out something after the
style of a tortoise when the land seems clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that, Mr. Scout Master?&rdquo; asked
Bumpus.</p>
<p>Thad Brewster had a right to be called after
that fashion, for he had duly qualified for the
position, and received his commission from scout
headquarters, empowering him to take the place
of the regular scout master, when the latter could
not be present. As Dr. Philander Hobbs, the
young man who gave of his time and energies to
help the cause along, found himself unable to accompany
the scouts on many of their outings, the
necessity of assuming command frequently fell
wholly on Thad, who had always acquitted himself
very well indeed.</p>
<p>Thad laughed as he noted their eagerness to hear
his admission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to own up, fellows,&rdquo; he went on to
say frankly, &ldquo;that I did read the paper, just as
Davy Jones says happened with him; and when I
saw the chances there were of a storm coming
down on us, I made up my mind we ought to go
prepared. But even if we didn&rsquo;t have a rubber
poncho along I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to wager we&rsquo;d
get through in pretty decent shape.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Thad,&rdquo; commented Giraffe; &ldquo;after
scouts have gone the limit, like we did down South
last winter, when the schoolhouse burned, and we
had a fine vacation before the new brick one was
completed, they ought to be able to buck up against
nearly anything, and come out of the big end of
the horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horn!&rdquo; echoed Bumpus, involuntarily letting
his hand fall upon the silver-plated bugle he carried
so proudly, and the possession of which told
that he must be the bugler of the troop&mdash;&ldquo;Horn!
that reminds me I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to use
my dandy instrument only at reveille and taps for
quite some time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t start in now, Bumpus, whatever
you do,&rdquo; remonstrated Step Hen. &ldquo;To my mind a
horn&rsquo;s a good thing only on certain occasions.
Now, when I&rsquo;m just gettin&rsquo; the best sleep after
sun-up it&rsquo;s sure a shame to hear you tooting away
to beat the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But none of us make any sort of a row when
he blows the assembly at meal times, I notice,&rdquo;
Smithy remarked sagely; and not a protest was
raised, showing that in this particular the members
of the patrol were unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>The last exploit of the scouts had taken them
into the Far South, in fact among the lagoons
and swamps of Louisiana; and although some
months had since passed, it would seem as though
the events of that thrilling experience were still
being threshed out whenever the eight boys came
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Thad was an orphan, living with an uncle, a
quaint old man whom everyone knew as &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo;
Acting from information that had been received in
a round-about way, the leader of the scout patrol
had organized an expedition to go South during
the unexpected vacation, to look for a certain man
who had once worked for his widowed mother, and
was suspected of having been concerned in the
mysterious disappearance of Thad&rsquo;s little sister,
Pauline, some years back.</p>
<p>The boys had carried this enterprise through to
a successful termination; and after meeting with
many thrilling, likewise comical adventures, had
actually traced this man, and managed to recover
the child; who was now a happy inmate of the
Brewster home, the pride of old Daddy&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Judging from the numerous burdens with which
the eight boys were weighted down it would seem
that they must be in heavy marching order, after
the manner of troops afield. Each fellow carried
a blanket, folded so as to hang from his shoulder,
and with the two ends secured under the other
arm. Besides, he had a haversack that looked as
though it might contain more or less food and extra
clothing.</p>
<p>Giraffe also sported a frying-pan of generous
dimensions; another scout carried a coffee pot; and
doubtless the necessary tin cups, knives, forks, platters
and spoons would be forthcoming whenever
needed.</p>
<p>The convenient log which served the boys as a
seat lay close to the road along which they had
been tramping for hours that day, making inquiries
whenever a chance offered, and picking up clews
after the fashion of real scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>As the reason for their coming to this part of
the country has everything to do with our story,
it had better be explained before we follow Thad
and his chums any further along the rather muddy
road that led across country to the Susquehanna
River.</p>
<p>Just a couple of days before the coming of the
Easter holidays Thad had been asked over the
&rsquo;phone to come and see Judge Whittaker, one of
the most respected citizens of Cranford. Wondering
what the strange request could mean, the patrol
leader had immediately complied, after school
that same afternoon.</p>
<p>He heard a most remarkable thing, and one that
thrilled his nerves as they had not been stirred for
many a day. The Judge first of all told him that
he had long observed the doings of the scouts with
growing admiration, and finding himself in need
of assistance of a peculiar order, made bold to
call upon Thad to help him.</p>
<p>Shorn of all unnecessary particulars, it would
seem that the Judge, obeying a whim which he
now called the height of foolishness, and while
waiting for a new safe to be delivered from New
York to take the place of the one that had to be
opened by an expert because the time-lock had
gone wrong, had actually sewed a very valuable
paper in the red lining of an old faded blue coat
which was hanging in his closet, and which he kept
as a memento of the time his only son served in
the engineer corps of the army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>It seemed that as the Judge had married again,
his wife was not very fond of seeing that old blue
army overcoat with the red lining hanging around;
and thinking it a useless incumbrance, she had
figured that it would be doing more good shielding
some poor tramp from the cold than just tempting
the moths in that closet.</p>
<p>And so it came about that one day, upon looking
for the army coat, the Judge discovered to his
utmost dismay that it could not be found. When
he asked his wife, she was compelled to admit that
three days before, after pitying a shivering hobo
who came to the door and asked for food, she had
obeyed a sudden generous instinct and given him
the warm if faded blue overcoat.</p>
<p>The Judge was in a great predicament now.
His first thought was to start out in search of
&ldquo;Wandering George&rdquo; himself, and buy back the
coat, which the hobo could not imagine would be
worth more than a dollar or so at the most. Then,
when he remembered his rheumatism, and how unfitted
for such a chase he must be, the Judge gave
this plan up.</p>
<p>His next idea was to send to the city and have
a detective put on the track; but he had a horror
of doing this, because he fancied that most of
these professional detectives were only too ready
to demand blackmail if given half a chance; and
there was something about that paper which Judge
Whittaker did not want known in a public way.</p>
<p>And just about that time he happened to think
of Thad and his scouts; which gave him an inspiration.
He felt sure they would be able to
follow the hobo who wore the faded army overcoat,
and in due time come up with him. Then
Thad was to offer him a few dollars for the garment,
using his discretion so that the suspicions of
the tramp might not be aroused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>It promised to be a pretty chase, and already
they had been on the road for the better part of
two days, here and there learning that a man wearing
such a coat had been seen to pass along. Part
of the time they had tramped the ties of the railroad,
but latterly the chase had stuck to the highway.</p>
<p>Now, acting on the suggestion of the sorrowful
Judge, Thad had not told any one of the scouts,
saving his close chum Allan, what the real reason
of the hunt for the lost army coat meant. The
others simply fancied that Judge Whittaker valued
the old garment highly because his only son, now
in Alaska, had worn it during the Spanish-American
war, and was unwilling to have it come to such
a disgraceful end. All they thought about was the
fun of tracking the hobo and eventually bringing
back the old engineer corps overcoat to its late
owner. That was glory enough for Step Hen,
Giraffe, Bumpus and the rest. It afforded them a
chance to get in the open, and imagine for a time
at least that they were outdoing some of those
dusky warriors who, in the good old days of
&ldquo;Leatherstocking&rdquo; and others of Cooper&rsquo;s characters,
roamed these very same woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel rested enough, fellows,&rdquo; Thad now
told them, &ldquo;perhaps we&rsquo;d better get a move on
again. The last information we managed to pick
up told us this Wandering George, as he likes to
call himself, can&rsquo;t be a great distance ahead of
us now. In fact, I&rsquo;m in hopes that we may run
across him before night comes and forces us to
go into camp somewhere along the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Accordingly, the other scouts sprang to their
feet, everyone trying to make out that he was as
&ldquo;fresh as a daisy,&rdquo; though poor fat Bumpus gave
an audible groan when he pried himself loose from
that comfortable log. He was not built for long
hikes, though possessed of a stubborn nature that
made it hard for him to give up any object upon
which he had set his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve rested long enough,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe,
who, being tall and slim, was known as a
fine runner, and long distance pedestrian. &ldquo;Sorry
to say there won&rsquo;t be any wagon following us to
pick up stragglers; so if you fall down, Bumpus,
better stop at the first farmhouse you strike, and
wait till we come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little slur only caused the fat scout to look
at the speaker contemptuously; but from an unexpected
quarter help came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! you certainly do like to rub it into Bumpus,
Giraffe, because he&rsquo;s built on the heavy order,&rdquo;
Step Hen went on to say; &ldquo;but go slow, my
boy. Don&rsquo;t you know the battle isn&rsquo;t always to
the swift or the strong? Have you forgotten all
about the race between the hare and the tortoise;
and didn&rsquo;t the old slow-moving chap come in ahead,
after all? I&rsquo;ve known Bumpus to beat you out before
this. You may have to use a crow-bar to get
him started sometimes; but once he does move he
don&rsquo;t let little things balk him. Besides, it ain&rsquo;t
nice of you nagging him because he happens to
weigh twice as much as you do. Bumpus is all
right!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Step Hen; I&rsquo;ll remember that,&rdquo; observed
the freckled-face scout, as he gave his defender
an appreciative grin.</p>
<p>Down the road they went, straggling along without
any particular order, because Thad knew from
past experiences he could get better work out of
his followers when they relaxed. Still, they kept
pretty well bunched, for whenever the conversation
started up none of them wished to lose a word of
what was said.</p>
<p>On the previous night they had been forced to
make a temporary shelter with all manner of fence
rails, boughs from trees, and such brush as they
could find. Having their blankets along, and being
cheered with a camp fire during the night, the experience
had been rather delightful on the whole.</p>
<p>These energetic boys had been through so much
during the time they belonged to the Cranford
Scouts that nothing along ordinary lines seemed
to daunt them. They were well equipped for meeting
and overcoming such difficulties as might arise
to confront them on a trip like the present one;
in fact, they took keen delight in matching their
wits against all comers, and a victory only served
to whet their appetite for more problems to be
solved along the line of woodcraft knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>For something like half an hour they pushed
steadily along. Bumpus, in order to positively prove
to the sneering Giraffe that he was in the best of
condition, had actually pushed ahead with the leaders.
If he limped occasionally he did his best to
conceal the fact by mumbling something about the
nuisance of stepping on pebbles and being nearly
thrown off his balance; a ruse that caused the said
wily Giraffe to smile broadly, and wink toward
Step Hen knowingly.</p>
<p>However, this disposition of their forces enabled
Bumpus to make a discovery of apparently vast
importance, which he suddenly communicated to
the rest in what he intended to be a stage whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! hold on here, what&rsquo;s this I see ahead of
us, boys? Unless my eyes have gone back on me,
which I don&rsquo;t believe they have, there&rsquo;s the smoke
of a fire rising over yonder alongside the road;
and Thad, tell me, ain&rsquo;t there a couple of trampy
looking fellows sitting on stones cooking their
grub? Bully for us, fellows, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
a bit now if we&rsquo;d gone and ketched up with
our quarry right here and now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every scout stared as Bumpus was saying all
of this. They saw that smoke was undoubtedly
rising close to the road, showing the presence of
a fire; while their keen, practiced eyes, used to observing
things at long distances, told them that
in all probability the two men who occupied the
roadside camp belonged to the order of hoboes; for
their clothing showed signs of much wear and tear,
and moreover they were heating their coffee in old
tomato cans, after the time-tried custom of the
tramp tribe the country over.</p>
<p>Naturally, under the circumstances, this discovery
caused their hearts to beat with additional rapidity
as they contemplated an early closing of their
campaign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">SIGHING FOR TROUBLE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; ejaculated Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What at?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe; &ldquo;we ought to be
puffed up with pride over our success, and here you
go to pulling a long face. What ails you, Step
Hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this way,&rdquo; muttered the scout addressed
disconsolately; &ldquo;we never did run across
a better chance to have a great time than when
we started out on this hobo chase; and here it&rsquo;s
turned out too easy for anything. Shucks! a tenderfoot
might have followed that Wandering
George right along to here; and now all we&rsquo;ve
got to do is to surround the camp, and make him
fork over that old blue coat the judge loves so
well. It&rsquo;s a shame, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel something the same way you do, Step
Hen,&rdquo; remarked Allan; &ldquo;why, I figured on doing
all sorts of smart stunts while we were on this
hike; and here, before a chance comes along, we
corral our game!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as sorry as you, suh,&rdquo; observed the
Southern boy, with the accent that stamped him a
true Dixie lad; &ldquo;but I reckon now you wouldn&rsquo;t
have Thad tell us to sheer off, and give the hoboes
a chance to run away, just to let us keep up this
chase. We promised to recover that old army
coat for the judge, and for one I&rsquo;d be ashamed to
look him in the face again, suh, if we let it slip
through our fingers on account of wanting to
lengthen the sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right sort of talk, Bob White,&rdquo; said
Thad, with a nod of his head, and a sparkle in
his eyes. &ldquo;Much as we all like the sport of showing
what we know in the way of woodcraft, duty
comes first. And we couldn&rsquo;t shirk our responsibility
in this case just to gratify our liking for
action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the program, then, Thad?&rdquo; asked
Smithy, yawning as though he did not feel quite
as much interest in the chase as some of the others;
for Smithy of late, Thad noticed with regret, was
apparently losing some of his former vigor, and
acting as though ready to shirk his duty when it
did not happen to appeal to him very strongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have a little fun out of the thing by
planning a complete surround, can&rsquo;t we, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Step Hen eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you say yes to that, Mr. Scout Master,&rdquo;
added Giraffe; &ldquo;because it&rsquo;ll be apt to take some
of the sting out, after having our game come to
such a sudden end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say something along those lines,
boys, if you had let me,&rdquo; Thad told them. &ldquo;So
far the tramps have given no sign that they suspect
our being here. We&rsquo;ll arrange it so as to
surround the camp, and then at a signal from me
everybody stand up and show themselves. I&rsquo;ll
arrange it so that we&rsquo;ll make a complete circle
around the fire, and to do that we&rsquo;ll move in
couples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He immediately paired them off, and each detachment
was told what was expected of it in making
the move a practical success.</p>
<p>Even in these apparently small matters Thad
proved himself a capable commander, for he picked
out the most able to undertake the difficult part
of the work, while to Smithy and Bumpus was
delegated the easier task of crawling along the
side of the road until they found shelter close
to the hoboes&rsquo; fire.</p>
<p>Giraffe and Step Hen were ordered to cross
to the other side of the road and, making a little
detour, came up from the north. The remaining
four scouts branched off to the south, and it was
the intention of Thad, taking Davy Jones along, to
continue the enveloping movement until he could
approach from the opposite quarter, which would
mean along the road in the other direction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bob White and Allan would be taking
positions to the south, and then curbing their
impatience until Thad had signaled and learned
that all of them were in place.</p>
<p>This was a most interesting piece of work for
the boys. They delighted in just such practices,
and for the simple reason that it enabled them to
bring to bear on the matter all the knowledge they
had managed to accumulate connected with the
real tactics of scouting, as practiced by hunters
and Indians, as well as the advance guard of an
army sent out to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the enemy&rsquo;s lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>At a certain point Thad gave Allan and Bob
White the sign that they were to turn to one side,
and begin advancing toward the smoke again,
while he and Davy would keep straight on.</p>
<p>They did not have to creep as yet, but kept bending
low, in order to render the risk of being discovered
as small as possible. Later on, however,
as they headed toward the hub of the wheel, which
was marked by the cooking fire, Thad and his companion
did not hesitate to flatten themselves out
on occasion, and do some pretty fine wriggling in
passing from one patch of leafless bushes to another.</p>
<p>Every time they raised their heads cautiously to
look, Davy would give one of his little chuckles,
telling that the situation was eminently satisfactory,
so far as he could see.</p>
<p>The two men were still hovering over their miserable
little fire, which was such a poor excuse for
a cooking blaze that any practical scout must curl
his lip in disdain, knowing how easy it is to manage
so as to have red coals, instead of smoky wood,
when doing the cooking.</p>
<p>Davy could see that there was no longer the first
question about their being genuine tramps. A
dozen signs pointed to this fact; and he found
himself wondering which of the pair would turn
out to be Wandering George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>He did not see the faded blue army coat on
either of them; but then it would be only natural
for the possessor to discard this extra weight when
keeping so close to a warm blaze. Doubtless, the
object of their search would be found nearby, used
in lieu of a blanket, to cover the form of the new
owner as he slept in the open, or in some farmer&rsquo;s
haystack.</p>
<p>Several of the scouts carried guns, even Bumpus
having so burdened himself in the hope that
during their chase after the lost army coat they
might happen to run across some game worth taking,
in order to lend additional zest to the outing.</p>
<p>As Thad and Davy had chosen the longest task
in making for the further side of the hobo camp,
they could take it for granted when they finally
reached the position the scout leader had in his
eye, that all of the other detachments must by then
have arrived.</p>
<p>To test this Thad gave a peculiar little sound
that was as near like the bark of a fox as possible.
Every member of the patrol had in times past
perfected himself in making just that sort of sound,
and of course they would immediately recognize
it as the signal of the scout master, desirous of
knowing whether all of them had gained their positions.</p>
<p>There came an immediate &ldquo;ha! ha!&rdquo; from across
the road, and also from deeper in the woods, where
Allan and Bob White were lying; but none from
Bumpus and Smithy. Evidently, something had
happened to cause a delay there. Thinking they
had what they might call a &ldquo;snap,&rdquo; the two slow
moving scouts covering this quarter had delayed
their advance too long, and were now holding
back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>As the tramps, however, had heard those strange
barking sounds coming from three quarters, and
jumped to their feet in alarm, Thad did not consider
it wise to delay the exposure of their presence
any longer. Accordingly, he gave a shrill
whistle that was well known to the others.</p>
<p>Imagine the consternation of the hobo campers
when from behind concealing bushes they saw figures
in khaki rise up, some of them bearing threatening
guns. Even Bumpus and Smithy followed
suit, though not as near the fire as the rest.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first thought of the alarmed tramps
was that they were surrounded by a detachment
of the militia, for the sight of those khaki suits
must have stunned them. Before they could gather
their wits together to think of resistance Thad was
heard to call out with military precision:</p>
<p><a id="rfront" href="#front">&ldquo;Close in on all sides; and keep them well covered, boys!&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>At that those who carried guns made out to aim
them, and their manner was so threatening that
both hoboes immediately elevated their hands, as
though desirous of letting their captors see that
they did not expect to offer the slightest resistance.</p>
<p>Slowly the scouts came forward, converging
toward the common center, which of course was
the smoky fire, alongside of which those two old
tomato cans stood, each secured at the end of a
bunch of metal ribs taken from a cast-off umbrella.</p>
<p>That successful surround would have made a
picture worthy of being framed and hung upon
the wall of their meeting room in the home town,
some of the scouts may have proudly thought, as
they walked slowly forward, thrilled with the consciousness
of power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>The tramps kept turning around, to stare first
at one pair of boys and then at another lot, as
though hardly knowing whether they were awake
or dreaming.</p>
<p>If they had guilty consciences, connected with
stolen chickens, or other farm products, they must
have believed that the strong arm of the law had
found them out, and that the next thing on the
program would be their being marched off to some
country town lockup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw! it&rsquo;s too, too easy, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; grumbled
Step Hen disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like taking candy from the baby!&rdquo; added Giraffe,
who always liked to have some spice connected
with their adventures, and could not bear
the idea of being on a team that outclassed its
rival in every department; a tough struggle was
what appealed to him every time, though of course
he wanted the victory to eventually settle on the
banner of the Silver Fox Patrol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes me think of that old couplet we used
to say about old Alexander,&rdquo; Bumpus here thought
it policy to remark, just to show them that he
too hoped there might have been some warm action
before the tramps surrendered; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see, how
does she go? &lsquo;Alexander with ten thousand men,
marched up the Alps, and down again!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe it was Hannibal you&rsquo;re thinking about,
Bumpus,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen; &ldquo;but it don&rsquo;t matter
much who did it, we&rsquo;ve gone and copied after him.
I say, we ought to go home by a roundabout
course, so as to try and stir things up some. This
is sure too easy a job for scouts that have been
through all we have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>The tramps were listening, and eagerly drinking
in all that was said; perhaps a faint hope had begun
to possess them that after all things might not
turn out to be quite as bad as first appearances
would indicate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, it&rsquo;s up to you to claim that coat now, so
we can evacuate this camp,&rdquo; observed Smithy, who
was observed to be pinching his nose with thumb
and forefinger, as though the near presence of
the tattered hoboes offended his olfactory nerves;
for as has been said before, the Smith boy had
been a regular dude at the time he joined the patrol,
and even at this late day the old trait occasionally
cropped out.</p>
<p>Thad looked around at his comrades, and somehow
when they saw the smile on his face a feeling
bordering on consternation seized hold of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Thad?&rdquo; asked Davy Jones solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why don&rsquo;t you tell us to get what we came
after, and fly the coop?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, who
did not fancy being so close to the ill-favored
tramps much more than the elegant Smithy did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing doing, fellows,&rdquo; said the acting
scout master, with an eloquent shrug of his
shoulders that carried even more weight than his
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; almost shrieked Step Hen, &ldquo;do you
mean to tell us that we&rsquo;re on the wrong trail, and
that neither of these gents is the one we want,
Wandering George?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what ails us,&rdquo; admitted Thad; &ldquo;we
counted our chickens before they were hatched,
that&rsquo;s all. Stop and remember the descriptions
we&rsquo;ve had of this Wandering George, and you&rsquo;ll
see how we&rsquo;ve been barking up the wrong tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes were immediately and eagerly focused
on the faces of the two wondering hoboes. At
the same time, no doubt, there was passing through
each boy&rsquo;s mind that description of the man who
had gone off with the faded army overcoat, and
which had been their mainstay in the way of a
clew, while following the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">WHEN BUMPUS CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE.</span></h2>
<p>A brief silence followed these words of the patrol
leader. Then the boys were seen to nod their
heads knowingly. It was evident that, once they
had their suspicions aroused by Thad, every fellow
could see what a dreadful mistake had been
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say now that Wandering George
was half a foot taller&rsquo;n either of these fellows!&rdquo;
declared Bumpus, being the first to control his
tongue, which was something remarkable, since as
a rule he was as slow of speech as he was with regard
to moving, on account of his weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had red hair in the bargain!&rdquo; added Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! everybody&rsquo;s doing it now,&rdquo; mocked Davy
Jones; &ldquo;and I can see that there ain&rsquo;t the first
sign of an old faded blue army overcoat anywhere
around <i>this</i> camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, who cares?&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe, as he
lowered his threatening gun; an act that doubtless
gave the two tramps much solid satisfaction. &ldquo;All
of us felt mean and sore because our fine tracking
game had come to such a sudden end. Now there&rsquo;s
still a chance we&rsquo;ll meet up with a few crackerjack
adventures before we pick the prize. I say
bully all around!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Davy Jones immediately threw himself into an
acrobatic position, and waved both of his feet wildly
in the air, as though he felt that the situation
might be beyond weak words, and called for something
stronger in order to express his exuberant
feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all of those things would be enough to
convince us we&rsquo;ve made a mistake,&rdquo; remarked
Thad; &ldquo;and if we want any further proof here it
is right before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the ground as he spoke. There
were a number of footprints in the half dried mud
close to the border of the road, evidently made
by the two men as they walked back and forth collecting
dead wood for their cooking fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Thad,&rdquo; commented Allan Hollister,
who of course instantly saw what the other
meant when he pointed in that way. &ldquo;We settled
it long ago that we ought to know Wandering
George any time we came up with him, simply
because he&rsquo;s got a rag tied around his right shoe
to keep it on his foot, it&rsquo;s that old, and going to
flinders. Neither of these men has need to do
that; in fact, if you notice, they&rsquo;ve both got shoes
on that look nearly new!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that one of the tramps hastened to speak, as
though he began to fear that as it was so remarkable
a thing for a road roamer to be wearing good
footgear, they were liable to arrest as having stolen
the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we done a little turn for a cobbler two
days back, over in Hooptown, an&rsquo; he give us the
shoes. Said he fixed &rsquo;em fur customers what didn&rsquo;t
ever come back to pay the charges; didn&rsquo;t we,
Smikes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We told him his barn was on fire, sure we did,
an&rsquo; helped him trow water on, an&rsquo; keep the thing
from burnin&rsquo; down. He gives us a hunky dinner,
an&rsquo; trows de trilbies in fur good measure.
But dey hurts us bad, an&rsquo; we was jest a-sayin&rsquo; we
wishes we had de ole uns back agin. If it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
so cold we&rsquo;d take &rsquo;em off right now, and go bare-footed,
wouldn&rsquo;t we, Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to us where you
got the shoes,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;We happen to be looking
for another man, and thought one of you might
be him. So go on with your cooking; and, Giraffe,
where&rsquo;s that knuckle of ham you said you
hated to lug any further, but which you thought
it a sin to throw away? Perhaps we might hand
the same over to Smikes and Jake, to pay up for
having given them such a bad scare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This caused the two tramps to grin in anxious
anticipation; and when Giraffe only too willingly
extracted the said remnant of a half ham which
the scouts had started with, they eagerly seized
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, young fellers,&rdquo; remarked the one
who had been called Smikes, as he clutched the
prize; &ldquo;we ain&rsquo;t a-carin&rsquo; if we gits the same kind
o&rsquo; a skeer &rsquo;bout once a day reg&rsquo;lar-like, hey, Jake?
Talk tuh me &rsquo;bout dinner rainin&rsquo; down frum the
clouds, this beats my time holler. Cum agin, boys,
an&rsquo; do it sum more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Thad knew it was folly to stay any longer at
the camp, but before leaving he wished to put a
question to the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a fellow who calls himself
Wandering George,&rdquo; he went on to say. &ldquo;Just
now he&rsquo;s wearing an old faded blue army overcoat
that was given to him by a lady who didn&rsquo;t
know that her husband valued it as a keepsake.
So we just offered to find it for him, and give
George a dollar or so to make up. Have either
of you seen a man wearing a blue coat like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixey, mister,&rdquo; replied Jake promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I used to wear a blue overcoat, like them,
when I was marchin&rsquo; fur ole Unc Sam in the
Spanish war, fool thet I was; but honest to goodness
now I ain&rsquo;t set eyes on the like this three years
an&rsquo; more,&rdquo; the second tramp asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it, then, fellows!&rdquo; ejaculated Step
Hen, with a note of joy in his voice; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got
to go on further, and run our quarry down. And
let me tell you I&rsquo;m tickled nearly to death because
it&rsquo;s turned out so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be you boys, anyhow?&rdquo; asked Smikes.
&ldquo;Air ye what we hears called scouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what we are,&rdquo; replied Allan. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why
we think it&rsquo;s so much fun to follow this Wandering
George, and trade him a big silver dollar for
the old coat the lady gave him when she saw he
made out to be cold. Scouts are crazy to do all
kinds of things like that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dew tell,&rdquo; muttered the tramp, shaking
his head; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t git on ter the trick, fur a fact.
If &rsquo;twar me now, I&rsquo;d rather be a-settin&rsquo; in a warm
room waitin&rsquo; tuh hear the dinner horn blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we all like to hear that, let me tell you,&rdquo;
asserted Giraffe, who was unusually fond of eating;
&ldquo;but we get tired of home cooking, and things
taste so fine when you&rsquo;re in camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! mebbe so, when yuh got plenty o&rsquo; the
right kind o&rsquo; stuff along,&rdquo; observed the man who
gripped the ham bone that Giraffe had tossed him,
&ldquo;but yuh&rsquo;d think a heap different, let me tell yuh,
if ever any of the lot knowed wat it meant tuh be
as hungry as a wolf, and nawthin&rsquo; tuh satisfy it
with. But then there seems tuh be all kinds o&rsquo;
people in this ole world; an&rsquo; they jest kaint understand
each other noways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad saw that the tramp was rather a queer customer,
and something along the order of a hobo
philosopher; but he had no more time just then
to stand and talk with him out of idle curiosity.</p>
<p>So he gave the order, and the scouts, wheeling
around, strode out upon the road, their faces set
toward the east. The last they saw of the two
tramps was just before turning a bend in the road
they looked back and saw that the men were apparently
hard at work dividing the remnant of
the ham that had been turned over by the boys
as some sort of solace to soothe their wounded feelings.</p>
<p>Half a mile further on and the woods gave place
to cultivated fields and pastures, although of course
it was too early in the season for much work to
be done by the farmers, except where they were
hauling fertilizer to make ready for the first
plowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we get the chance, boys, to-night, let&rsquo;s sleep
in a barn,&rdquo; suggested Giraffe, as he rubbed his right
shank as though it might pain him. &ldquo;Where we
lay last night it seemed to me a million roots and
stones kept pushing into my body till I was black
and blue this morning. And I always did like
to nestle down in good sweet hay. I don&rsquo;t blame
tramps for taking the chance every opportunity
that opens. What do the rest of you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me favorably,&rdquo; Step Hen quickly admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! any old place is good enough for me,&rdquo;
sighed Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can only be sure there are no rats
around, I believe I&rsquo;d enjoy sleeping in a hay mow,&rdquo;
Davy told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had the experience,&rdquo; remarked
Smithy with a shrug of his shoulders, and a
grimace; &ldquo;and I must confess I don&rsquo;t hanker much
for it. Bad enough to have to roll up in your own
blanket any old time; but spiders and hornets and
all that horrible set are to be found in haylofts,
they tell me. I&rsquo;m more afraid of them than an
alligator or a wild bull. A gypsy once told me I
would die from poison bites, and ever since I&rsquo;ve
had to be mighty careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the rest of the scouts had to laugh
to hear Smithy confess that he believed in the
prophecy of a gypsy, or any other fake fortune-teller.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lie awake a minute,&rdquo; ventured Step
Hen, &ldquo;if a dozen gypsies told me I was going to
break my neck falling out of bed. Fact is, I&rsquo;m
built so contrary that like as not I&rsquo;d hunt up the
highest bed I could find to sleep on. I do everything
on Friday I can think of; and when the
thirteenth of the month comes around I&rsquo;m always
looking out to see how I can tempt fate. Ain&rsquo;t
an ounce of superstition in my whole body, I guess.
Fortune-tellers! Bah! you ought to have been a
girl, Smithy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, I didn&rsquo;t say I <i>believed</i> I&rsquo;d die by
poison, did I?&rdquo; demanded the other adroitly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
only explaining that I don&rsquo;t mean to let the silly
prophecy come true by taking hazards that are quite
unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me we&rsquo;ve been walking like hot cakes
ever since we said good-by to Smikes and Jake,&rdquo;
observed Bumpus, who was puffing a little from
his exertions; &ldquo;and Thad, would you mind if we
took a little breathing spell about now? Just see
how inviting this pile of old fence rails looks alongside
the road. I hope you say yes, Thad, because
I want to get fit to keep on the go till dark comes
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No objections to favoring you, Bumpus,&rdquo; Thad
told him; &ldquo;and if looks count for anything I rather
think all the rest of us will be glad of a chance to
rest up a little. So drop down, and take things
easy, boys. I&rsquo;ll give you ten minutes here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look sharp before you sit down!&rdquo; warned
Smithy, who had disengaged his blanket, as though
meaning to use it for a soft cushion&mdash;time was
when he invariably brushed a board or other intended
resting-place with his handkerchief before
sitting down; but the other scouts had long ago
laughed him out of this habit, which jarred upon
their nerves as hardly consistent with rough-and-ready
scout life.</p>
<p>Giraffe had a most remarkable pair of eyes. He
often discovered things that no one else had any
suspicion existed. On this account, as well as the
fact that he was able to see further and more
accurately than his chums, he was sometimes designated
as &ldquo;Old Eagle Eye,&rdquo; and the employment of
that name invariably gave him more or less pleasure,
since it proclaimed his superiority in the line
of observation.</p>
<p>Giraffe was also a great hand for practical
jokes. When some idea flashed into his mind he
often gave little heed to the possible result, but
immediately felt impelled to put his scheme into
practice, with the sole idea of creating a laugh, of
course with another scout as the victim.</p>
<p>They had hardly been sitting there five minutes
when Giraffe might have been heard chuckling
softly to himself, though no one seemed to pay any
particular attention to him.</p>
<p>He elevated that long neck of his once or twice
as if desirous of making sure concerning a certain
point before going any further. Then, when satisfied
on this score, he glanced from one to another
of his companions, evidently seeking a victim.</p>
<p>When his gaze, after going along the entire line,
returned once more to plump, good-natured Bumpus,
who had now ceased puffing, and was looking
rested, it might be set down as certain that there
was trouble of some sort in store for the red-haired,
freckle-faced scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Now Giraffe was a sharp schemer. He knew
how to go about his business in a way least calculated
to arouse suspicion.</p>
<p>Instead of immediately blurting out what he had
in mind, he started to &ldquo;beating around the bush,&rdquo;
seeking to first disarm his intended victim by drawing
him into a little discussion.</p>
<p>Before another full minute had passed Thad
noticed that Giraffe and Bumpus were warmly discussing
some matter, and that the stout scout
seemed to be unusually in earnest. Doubtless, this
was on account of the sly assertions which Giraffe
inflicted upon him, the tall scout being a
past master when it came to giving little digs that
hurt worse than pins thrust into one&rsquo;s flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I <i>can</i> do it!&rdquo; Bumpus was heard to
say stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d ever come within a mile
of making it, and that goes, Bumpus.&rdquo; Giraffe
went on as though he might be a Doubting Thomas
who could only be convinced by actual contact;
&ldquo;and tell you what I&rsquo;ll do to prove I&rsquo;m in earnest.
If you make it in three trials, straddling the limb
while my watch is counting a whole minute, I&rsquo;ll
hand over that fine compass you always liked so
much. How&rsquo;s that, Bumpus; are you game to show
us, or have I dared you to a standstill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, <i>me</i> back down for a little thing like that?
Well, you just watch me make you eat your words,
Giraffe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>So saying the fat scout clambered up over the
rail fence, and dropped in the open pasture beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he going to do?&rdquo; asked Thad, as they
saw Bumpus start on a waddling sort of gait
toward a tree that stood by itself some little distance
from the fence, and with a clump of bushes
not far away.</p>
<p>He looked a little suspiciously at Giraffe, who
immediately stopped his chuckling, and tried to
draw a solemn face, though he shut one eye in a
humorous fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he started to boast that he had been doing
some fine climbing lately,&rdquo; explained the tall
scout; &ldquo;and I dared him to go over and get up
in that tree while I held the watch on him. He&rsquo;s
got to start climbing and make it inside of sixty
seconds; and between you and me, Thad, I reckon
now he might manage it in half that time&mdash;if hard
pushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some game started, Giraffe; what
is it?&rdquo; asked the patrol leader, as he turned again
and watched the portly scout moving like a ponderous
machine toward the tree which Giraffe had
mentioned as a part of the contract.</p>
<p>Giraffe did not need to answer, for at that very
second there came what seemed to be a loud bellow
of rage from over in the field somewhere. Looking
hastily through the bars of the fence, the seven
boys saw a spectacle that thrilled them with various
emotions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>From out of the sheltering bushes, where those
keen roving eyes of Giraffe must have discovered
her presence, came a dun-colored cow. Possibly
her calf had recently been taken from her by the
butcher, for she was furious toward all humankind.
Her tail was held in the air, and as she ran
straight toward poor Bumpus she stopped for a
moment several times to toss a cloud of earth up
with her hoofs, for she had no horns, Thad noted,
which was at least one thing favoring Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">GIRAFFE ADMITS THAT THE SHOE FITS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Bumpus!&rdquo; shrieked Davy Jones, as
though instantly realizing what a perilous position
the stout scout would be in if that angry cow
succeeded in bowling him over with her hornless
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run! run, Bumpus; a wild bull is after you!&rdquo;
shouted Step Hen, who may have really believed
what he was saying with such a vim; or else considered
that by magnifying the danger he might
add more or less to the sprinting ability of the
said Bumpus.</p>
<p>There was really little need to send all these
warnings pealing over the field, because Bumpus
had already glimpsed the oncoming enemy, and
was in full flight.</p>
<p>At the moment of discovery he chanced to be
fully two-thirds of the way over to the tree which
had been the special object of his attention. It
was therefore much easier for him to reach this
haven of refuge than it would have been to dash
for the fence with any hope of making that barrier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Bumpus, I&rsquo;ll bet on you!&rdquo; howled Giraffe,
jumping up on the fence in his great excitement,
so that he might not miss seeing anything
of the amusing affair.</p>
<p>Now, possibly, the angry cow that had been bereft
of her beloved calf by a late visit of the butcher
might have readily overhauled poor Bumpus had
she kept straight on without a stop, for she could
cover two yards to his one. For some reason which
only a cow or bull could understand, the animal
seemed to consider it absolutely necessary that with
every few paces she must come to a halt and paw
the ground again, sending the earth flying about
her.</p>
<p>That gave the stout runner his chance, and so
he succeeded in gaining the tree, with his four-footed
enemy still a little distance away.</p>
<p>Bumpus was evidently unnerved. He had seen
that terrifying spectacle several times as he looked
anxiously over his fat shoulder, and it had always
caused him to put on an additional spurt.</p>
<p>When finally he banged up against the tree,
having of course stumbled as usual, his one idea
was to climb with lightning speed. His agreement
with the scheming Giraffe called for an ascent in
sixty seconds, but he now had good reason for
desiring to shorten this limit exceedingly. He
doubtless imagined that he would feel the crash
of that butting head against his person before he
had ascended five feet, and this completely rattled
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Left to himself and possibly he could have
climbed the smooth trunk within the limit of time
specified in his arrangement with Giraffe; but such
was his excitement now that he made a sorry mess
of it.</p>
<p>The boys were shrieking all sorts of instructions
to him to &ldquo;hurry up,&rdquo; or he was bound to become
a victim; one was begging him with tears in his
eyes to &ldquo;get a move on him!&rdquo; while another warned
Bumpus of the near approach of the oncoming cow,
and also the fact that she had &ldquo;fire in her eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice did the scout manage to get part way up,
when in his tremendous excitement he lost his grip,
and in consequence slipped down again, amid a
chorus of hollow groans from the watchers beyond
the fence.</p>
<p>The avenging cow was now close up, and still
enjoying the situation, as was evidenced by the
way she made the earth fly. She could be heard
giving a series of strange moaning sounds peculiarly
terrifying; at least Bumpus evidently
thought so, for after his second fall he just sat
there, and stared at the oncoming enemy as if he
had actually lost his wits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get behind the tree, Bumpus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Thad shouting, and using both his
hands in lieu of any better megaphone. Now,
since Thad had always been the leader of the patrol
ever since its formation, Bumpus was quite
accustomed to obeying any order which the other
might give. Doubtless, he recognized the accustomed
authority in those tones; at any rate, it was
noticed that he once more began to make a move,
struggling to his feet in his usual clumsy way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he just missed getting struck!&rdquo; ejaculated
Smithy, as they saw Bumpus move around the tree,
and heard a loud crash when the head of the charging
cow smashed against the covering object.</p>
<p>The animal was apparently somewhat stunned
by the contact, for she stood there, looking a little
&ldquo;groggy,&rdquo; as Giraffe called it. Had Bumpus
known enough to remain perfectly still, and allow
the tree to shelter him the best it could, all might
have gone well; but something that may have been
boyish curiosity impelled the fat scout to thrust
out his head. Why, he had so far recovered from
his fright, thanks to the substantial aid of that
tree-trunk, that he actually put his fingers to his
nose, and wiggled them at the cow!</p>
<p>She must have seen him do it, and immediately
resented the implied insult; for all of a sudden
she was seen to be in motion again. There was
a flash of dun-colored sides, and around the tree
the cow sped, chasing Bumpus ahead of her.</p>
<p>Of course the scout did not have to cover as
much ground as the animal, but the fact must be
remembered that he was a very clumsy fellow,
and apt to trip over his own feet when excited, so
that the danger of his falling a victim to the rage
of the mother cow was as acute as ever, despite the
sheltering tree.</p>
<p>Giraffe seemed to be enjoying the game immensely.
He sat there, perched on the rail fence,
and clapped his hands with glee, while shouting
all manner of brotherly advice at Bumpus. This
of course fell on deaf ears, because just then the
imperiled scout could think of only one thing at
a time, and that was to keep out of reach of that
battering ram.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Thad knew that something must be done to help
Bumpus, who if left to his own resources never
would be able to extricate himself from the bad
fix into which he had stumbled, thanks to that
love of a joke on the part of Giraffe, and his own
blindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there, Bumpus, she thinks you look like the
butcher that took her calf away, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the
matter!&rdquo; cried Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity you ain&rsquo;t a cow puncher, Bumpus,&rdquo; Giraffe
went on to say; &ldquo;because then you could throw
that poor thing easy. Huh! think I could do it
with one hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then suppose you get off that fence and do it!&rdquo;
said Thad severely. &ldquo;You got poor old Bumpus
in that hole, and it ought to be your business to
rescue him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe looked dubious. When he spoke so confidently
about believing himself able to down the
raging cow he certainly could not have meant it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he ain&rsquo;t going to get hurt, Thad,&rdquo; he
started to say; &ldquo;if I saw him knocked down, course
I&rsquo;d jump and run to help him. The exercise ought
to do Bumpus good, for he&rsquo;s been putting on too
much flesh lately, you know. You&rsquo;ll have to excuse
me, Thad, sure you will. I&rsquo;ll go if things look
bad for him; but I hate to break up the game now
by interfering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad paid no more attention to Giraffe, since he
knew that the other&rsquo;s inordinate love for practical
joking made him blind to facts that as a true scout
he should have kept before his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Bumpus!&rdquo; the patrol leader once more
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;T-had, what is it?&rdquo; came back in a wheezy
voice, for to tell the truth Bumpus was getting
pretty well winded by now, thanks to the rapid
manner in which he had to navigate around that
tree again, with the active bovine in pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off that red bandanna from your neck,
and put it in your pocket!&rdquo; ordered the patrol
leader.</p>
<p>Strange to say no one else&mdash;saving possibly the
artful Giraffe&mdash;had once considered this glaring
fact, that much of the cow&rsquo;s anger was excited
by seeing the hated color so prominently displayed
by the boy who had invaded the pasture at such
an unfortunate time in her life of frequent bereavements.</p>
<p>Taking it for granted that Bumpus would obey
the first chance he got to unfasten the knot by
which his big bandanna was secured around his
neck, Thad clambered over the fence and started
to run.</p>
<p>He did not head directly for the tree around
which this exciting chase was being carried on,
but obliquely. In doing this Thad had several
reasons, no doubt. First of all he was more apt
to catch the attention of the angry cow, for he
was waving his own red handkerchief wildly as he
ran, and doing everything else in his power to
attract notice. Then, if he did succeed in luring
the animal toward him he would be taking her
away from the tree at such an angle that when
Bumpus headed for the spot where his other chums
were gathered the cow would not be apt to see
him in motion and give chase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Thad knew how to work the thing nicely. He
succeeded in attracting the attention of the cow,
for he saw her stop in her pursuit of Bumpus, and
start to pawing the turf again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming, Thad!&rdquo; roared Allan.</p>
<p>As he spoke the cow started on a full run for
the new enemy. That flaunting red rag bade her
defiance, apparently, and no respectable bovine
could refuse to accept such a gage of battle.</p>
<p>Thad had not gone far away from the fence
at any time. He was not hankering to play the
part of a bull-baiter, and run the chance of being
tossed high in the air, or butted into the ground.</p>
<p>He had, like a wise general, also marked out
the way of retreat, and when the onrushing animal
was fully started, so that there seemed to be
little likelihood of her stopping short of the fence,
Thad nimbly darted along, and just at the proper
time he was seen to make a flying leap that landed
him on the top rail, from which he instantly
dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>He continued to flaunt the red handkerchief as
close to the nose of the cow as he could, so as to
hold her attention; while she butted the fence again
and again, as only an angry and baffled beast
might.</p>
<p>Thad was meanwhile again shouting his directions
to the dazed Bumpus, who, winded by his
recent tremendous exertions, had actually sunk
down at the base of the friendly tree as though
exhausted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get moving, Bumpus!&rdquo; was what the patrol
leader told him. &ldquo;Back away, and try to keep the
tree between the cow and yourself all you can.
Don&rsquo;t waste a single minute, because she may break
away from me, and hunt you up again! Get a
move on you, Bumpus, do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally aroused to a consciousness of the fact
that he was not yet &ldquo;out of the woods&rdquo; so long as
no fence separated him from that fighting cow,
Bumpus started in to obey the directions given
by the leader of the Silver Fox Patrol.</p>
<p>It was no difficult matter to back away, keeping
in a line that would allow the tree to cover him,
and the fat scout in this manner drew steadily
closer to where his comrades awaited him.</p>
<p>He was near the fence when the cow must have
discovered him again, for the first thing Bumpus
knew he heard Davy shrieking madly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run like everything, Bumpus! Whoop! here
she comes, licketty-split after you! To the fence,
and we&rsquo;ll help you over, Bumpus! Come on! Come
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which Bumpus was of course doing the best
he knew how, not even daring to look over his
shoulder for fear of being petrified by the awful
sight of that &ldquo;monster&rdquo; charging after him, and
appearing ten times as big as she really was.</p>
<p>Arriving at the fence he found Davy and Giraffe
awaiting him, for the latter, possibly arriving
at the repentant stage, had begun to realize
that a joke may often be very one-sided, and that
&ldquo;what is fun for the boys is death to the frogs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Assisted by their willing arms the almost breathless
fat scout was hustled over the fence. There
was indeed little time to spare. Hardly had Davy
and Giraffe managed to follow after him, so that
all three landed beyond the barrier, when the baffled
bovine arrived on the spot, to bellow with
rage as she realized that her intended prey had
escaped for good.</p>
<p>Bumpus was hardly able to breathe. He was
fiery red in the face, and quite wet with perspiration;
but nevertheless he looked suspiciously at Giraffe,
as though a dim idea might be taking shape
in that slow-moving mind of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Bumpus! You don&rsquo;t get that compass
this time,&rdquo; asserted the tall scout, shaking his head
in the negative, while he grinned at Bumpus.
&ldquo;You never climbed the tree at all, you know. Our
little wager is off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought you knew&mdash;about that pesky cow,
Giraffe&mdash;I&rsquo;d consider that you played me a low-down
trick!&rdquo; said Bumpus, between gasps.</p>
<p>Giraffe made no reply. Perhaps the enormity of
his offense had begun to trouble him, because Bumpus
was such a good-natured fellow, with his sunny
blue eyes, and his willing disposition, that it really
seemed a shame to take advantage of his confiding
nature. So Giraffe turned aside, and amused himself
by thrusting his hand, containing his own red
bandanna, through the openings between the rails of
the fence, and tempting the cow to butt at him,
when, of course, he would adroitly withdraw from
reach in good time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>When Bumpus had fully recovered his breath,
the march was resumed. Giraffe loitered behind a
bit. He knew from the signs that he was in for
what he called a &ldquo;hauling over the coals&rdquo; by the
patrol leader, and fully expected to see Thad drop
back to join him. The sooner the unpleasant episode
was over with the better&mdash;that was Giraffe&rsquo;s
way of looking at it, and he was really inviting
Thad to hurry up and get the scolding out of his
system.</p>
<p>Sure enough, presently Thad dropped back and
joined him. Looking up out of the tail of his eye,
Giraffe saw that the other was observing him severely.
He fully expected to hear something unpleasant
about the duty one scout ought to assume
toward his fellows. To his surprise Thad started
on another tack entirely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you a little story I read the other
day, Giraffe,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;and, if the shoe fits,
you can put it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Thad; you know I like to hear stories
first rate,&rdquo; mumbled Giraffe, glad at least that the
others of the party were far enough ahead so that
none of them could hear what passed between himself
and the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; began Thad, &ldquo;it was told to illustrate
the old saying that &lsquo;curses, like chickens, come home
to roost.&rsquo; The lecturer went on to say that when
a boy throws a rubber ball against a wall it bounds
back, and, unless he is careful, it&rsquo;s apt to take him
in the eye; and that&rsquo;s the way everything we do
comes back to us some time or other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing it does; and p&rsquo;raps some day I expect
Bumpus will be getting one over on me to
pay the score,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe; but Thad did not
pay any attention to what he said, only went on
with his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was once a boy, a thoughtless boy, with
a little cruel streak in his make-up, who always
wanted to find a chance for a good laugh, without
thinking of what pain he might be causing others,&rdquo;
Thad went on, at which Giraffe winced, for the
shaft went home. &ldquo;One day he was playing on a
hillside with their big dog, Rover. He would roll
a stone down the hill, and Rover would obediently
run after it, and bring it back. He seemed to be
enjoying the sport as much as the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all at once the boy discovered a big hornet&rsquo;s
nest almost a foot in diameter, hanging low
down on a bush. He saw a chance to have a great
lark. He would roll a stone so as to hit the nest,
and send Rover after it. Then the hornets would
come raging out, and it would be such a lark to
see them chasing poor Rover down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the stone he rolled went true to the
mark, and came slam against the hornet&rsquo;s nest.
Rover was in full pursuit, and he banged up against
it, too. Out came a black swarm of furious hornets,
and of course they tackled poor Rover like
everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy up on the hill laughed until he nearly
doubled up, to hear Rover yelp, and whirl around
this way and that. He thought he had never had
such a bully time in all his life as just then. Rover
was a fine dog, and the boy thought just heaps of
him; but then it was so comical to see how he
twisted, and bit at himself, and he howled so
fiercely, too, that the boy could hardly get his
breath for laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But all at once he saw to his alarm that poor
Rover, unable to help himself, was running up the
hill straight to his master, as though thinking that
the boy could save him. Then the boy stopped
laughing. It didn&rsquo;t seem so funny then. And,
Giraffe, inside of ten seconds there was a boy running
madly down the hill, fighting a thousand mad
hornets that stung him everywhere, and set him
to yelling as if he were half crazy. When he got
home finally, and saw his swollen face in the glass,
and felt Rover licking his hand as if the good fellow
did not dream that his master had betrayed him
so meanly, what do you suppose that boy said to
himself, if he had any conscience at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe looked up. He was as red in the face
as any turkey that ever strutted and gobbled.
Giraffe at least had a conscience, as his words
proved beyond any doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Served him right, Thad; that&rsquo;s what I say! And
I thank you for telling me that story. It&rsquo;s a hummer,
all right, and I won&rsquo;t ever forget it, either, I
promise you. It <i>was</i> a cruel joke, and some time
I&rsquo;m going to make up for playing it. That&rsquo;s all I
want to say, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the wise patrol leader, knowing that it would
do Giraffe a lot more good to commune with himself
just then, rather than to be taken to task any
further, walked away, to rejoin Allan, who was at
the head of the expedition. Nor did Giraffe make
any effort to hasten his footsteps so as to catch up
with the rest, until quite some little time had elapsed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP IN THE HAYMOW.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a farmhouse over yonder, Thad; and
night&rsquo;s coming on pretty fast now!&rdquo; called out Davy
Jones later on, after the expedition had covered
several more miles of ground, and seemed to be
descending an incline that would very likely shortly
take them to the bank of the winding Susquehanna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we decide to bunk in a haymow, and not
out in the open to-night,&rdquo; added Step Hen. &ldquo;Not
having any tents along makes it a poor business trying
to keep off the rain, if she should drop in on
us. How about it, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon, suh, we&rsquo;re all of one mind there,&rdquo; remarked
Bob White.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, boys,&rdquo; Thad announced. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
turn in here, and see if the farmer will allow us
to camp in his barnyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mebbe he might sell us a couple of fat chickens,
and some fresh milk or cream to go with our
coffee. That would be about as fine as silk, I&rsquo;m
telling you,&rdquo; and Giraffe, who had rejoined his comrades,
looking just the same as ever, rubbed his
stomach as he said this, by that means implying
that the prospect pleased him even more than words
could tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Accordingly the line of march was changed.
They abandoned the road, and started up the lane
that led to the farmhouse. A watchdog began barking
furiously, and at the sound several people came
out of the house, and the big barn as well; so that
while the scouts had clustered a little closer together,
as though wishing to be ready for an attack,
they knew there was now nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Three minutes later and they were talking with
the grizzled farmer, his good wife, a couple of girls,
and the stout young hired help named Hiram, all
of whom were fairly dazzled by the sight of eight
khaki-clad young fellows, some of whom carried
shotguns, grouped in their dooryard.</p>
<p>Thad explained that they were a patrol of Boy
Scouts from Cranford, on a hike, and not having
tents along with them, made bold to ask the farmer
if they might sleep in his haymow, and cook their
supper in the open space before the barns.</p>
<p>There was something inviting about Thad Brewster&rsquo;s
manner that drew most people toward him.
That same farmer might have been tempted to say
no under ordinary conditions, for he looked like a
severe man; but somehow he was quite captivated
by the manly appearance of these lads. Besides, he
had doubtless read considerable about the activities
of the scouts, and felt that the chance of hearing
something concerning them at first hand was too
good to be lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got the least objection to you boys sleeping
in my hay, if you promise me not to light
matches, or do any smokin&rsquo; there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out for that, sir,&rdquo; replied Thad
promptly, &ldquo;and we all promise you that there will
be no damage done from our staying over. We will
want to make a cooking fire somewhere, but it can
be done at a safe distance from the barn, and to
leeward, so that any sparks will go the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if so be you could spare us a couple of
chickens, mister,&rdquo; put in Giraffe, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d be glad to
pay you the full market price; as also for any milk
or cream or eggs you&rsquo;d let us have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you can fix that with the missus,&rdquo; returned
the farmer; &ldquo;she runs that end of the farm. I look
after the crops and the stock. Now, if you wanted
a four-hundred-pound pig I&rsquo;ve got a beauty to offer
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, awfully,&rdquo; returned Step Hen quickly,
giving Giraffe, who was a big eater, a meaning
look; &ldquo;but I reckon we&rsquo;re well supplied in that way
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrangements were quickly made with the farmer&rsquo;s
wife, and under charge of the willing Hiram,
who never could get over staring at the uniforms
of the scouts with envy in his pale eyes, some of
the boys gave chase to a couple of ambitious young
roosters that were trying their first crow on a nearby
fence, finally capturing and beheading the same.</p>
<p>Thad meanwhile accompanied the good woman
to her dairy, and returned with a brimming bucket
of morning&rsquo;s milk, as well as a pitcher of the thickest
yellow cream any of them had ever gazed upon.</p>
<p>The girls brought out some fresh eggs, and altogether
the sight of so much riches caused Giraffe
to smile all over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Giraffe was the acknowledged leader when it came
to making fires, and that duty as a rule devolved
upon him. He had made a particular study of the
art, and in pursuing his hobby to the limits was able
to get fire at his pleasure, whether he had a match
or not. And in more than a few times in the past
this knowledge had proved very useful to the tall
scout, as the record in previous stories concerning
the doings of the Silver Fox Patrol will explain.</p>
<p>Accordingly Giraffe had chosen to make a neat
little fireplace out of smooth blocks of stone which
happened to lie handy. This he had built at the
spot selected by Thad as perfectly safe; for what
little wind there was would blow the sparks in a
direction where they could do no possible damage.</p>
<p>When Hiram came back he forgot all about any
chores that might be waiting. Never before had
he been given such a glorious chance to witness the
smart doings of Boy Scouts. He observed everything
Giraffe did when he made that cunning little
out-of-doors cooking range, and noted that while
the double row of stones spread wide apart at one
end, just so the big frying pan would set across,
they drew much closer at the other terminus, like
the letter V, so that the coffee pot could be laid there
without spilling.</p>
<p>Then Giraffe started his fire. Hiram noticed how
he picked certain kinds of wood from the abundant
supply over at the chopping block. Giraffe liked to
be in the lime light; and he was also an accommodating
chap. He saw that the farmhand was intensely
interested, as well as quite green at all such
things; but the fact of his &ldquo;wanting to know&rdquo; was
enough to start the scout to imparting information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>So he told Hiram how certain kinds of wood are
more suitable for cooking purposes, since they make
a fierce heat, and leave red ashes that hold for a
long time; and it is over such a bed that the best
cooking can be done, and not when there is more
or less flame and smoke to interfere.</p>
<p>Allan and Davy had been very busy plucking the
fowls during this time, while Bumpus busied himself
getting some fresh water from the well near
by, and fixing the coffee ready to go on the fire
when Giraffe gave the word that he was prepared.</p>
<p>One of the girls brought a loaf of fresh homemade
bread, and a roll of genuine country butter
that was as sweet as could be. Fancy with what
impatience those boys waited while supper was being
cooked. The odors that arose when the cut-up
chicken was browning in the pan along with some
slices of salt pork, and the coffee steaming on one
of the stones alongside the fire, made a combination
that fairly set several of the fellows wild, so that
they had to walk away in order to control themselves.</p>
<p>Finally the welcome signal was given by Bumpus,
and never had those silver notes of the &ldquo;assembly&rdquo;
sounded sweeter in mortal ears than they did that
night in the barnyard of that Susquehanna farm,
with the eight khaki-clad scouts sitting on logs, and
any other thing that offered, and every inmate of
the farmhouse gathered near by to watch operations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>They had a feast indeed, and there was plenty
for every one and to spare. Indeed, Hiram had accepted
the invitation of Giraffe to hold off supper,
and join them, and the big fellow seemed to be enjoying
his novel experience vastly, if one could
judge from the broad grin that never once left his
rosy face.</p>
<p>After the meal was over they found seats, and
as the fire sparkled and crackled merrily Thad told
them all that he possibly could about the aims and
ambitions of the scout movement. He found a
very attentive and appreciative audience; and it was
possible that seeds were planted in the mind of
Hiram on that occasion calculated to bear more or
less good fruit later on in his life.</p>
<p>Of course Thad had to explain to some extent why
they were so far away from home, and this necessitated
relating the story about the old army overcoat
that had been turned over to a tramp through
the desire of the judge&rsquo;s second wife to get rid of it.
Thad of course only went so far as to say that the
judge mourned the loss of an article which he really
valued highly on account of its association with
his only son&rsquo;s army life years before; and he made
out such a strong case that those who heard the
story could easily understand why the gentleman
should wish to recover the garment again, if it were
possible.</p>
<p>None of them could remember having seen any
party wearing such a coat; and it would seem that
if the hobo had passed along that way, he might
have applied at the farmhouse for a meal, though
the presence of the dog usually deterred those of
his kind from bothering the good farm wife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess they&rsquo;ve got the chalk mark on your gate
post, mister,&rdquo; commented Step Hen, when he heard
this; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told these hoboes leave signs all
along the way for the next comer to read. Some
places they say are good for a square meal; then at
another place you want to look sharp, for the farmer&rsquo;s
wife will ring pies on you that are guaranteed
to break off a tooth in trying to bite &rsquo;em. Now,
like as not there&rsquo;s a sign on your post that says:
&lsquo;Beware of the dog; he&rsquo;s a holy terror!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there is,&rdquo; replied the farmer; &ldquo;and if I
knew what it was I&rsquo;d see it got on every post I own,
for if there&rsquo;s one thing I hate it&rsquo;s a tramp. I&rsquo;ve
had my chickens stolen, my hogs poisoned, and my
haymow out in the pasture burned twice by some of
that worthless lot. They kind of know me by now,
and that I ain&rsquo;t to be trifled with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening passed all too quickly; and when
Step Hen happened to mention that Bumpus was
the possessor of a beautiful soprano voice of course
the country girls insisted that he entertain them.
Bumpus, as has been remarked before, was an accommodating
fellow, and he allowed himself to be
coaxed to sing one song after another, with all of
them joining in the chorus, until he was too hoarse
to keep it up. Then they spied his lovely silver-plated
bugle, and nothing would do but he must
sound all the army calls he knew, which added to
the enjoyment considerably.</p>
<p>Taken in all, that was the most novel entertainment
any of them had ever experienced; and especially
those who lived in the lonely farmhouse.
It must have been a tremendous and pleasant break
in the monotony that usually hangs like a pall upon
all farm work. No wonder, Thad thought, all of
them looked so happy when they were bidding the
boys good night, and admitted that they had enjoyed
the coming of the expedition greatly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Hiram could not be &ldquo;pried loose,&rdquo; as Giraffe said.
He insisted on seeing all he could of these new and
remarkable friends, and had announced his intention
of accompanying the scouts to the hay, and
sleeping near them.</p>
<p>No one offered the least objection. Indeed, by
this time, after such an exhausting march as they
had been through since sun-up, all of them were
pretty tired, and their one thought was to snuggle
down in the hay, with their blankets wrapped
around them, and get some sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still cloudy and threatening,&rdquo; remarked Allen,
as he and Thad took a last look around ere turning
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s holding off in a queer way,&rdquo; replied the
other, &ldquo;but when it does hit us, look out for a downpour.
I&rsquo;d be glad if we ran on that Wandering
George before the rain starts in, because it&rsquo;ll be
hard getting around when the whole country is
soaked and afloat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told the river is already close to flood stage,
owing to so much snow melting at headwaters,&rdquo; observed
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we had an unusual lot last winter, you remember;
and when the weather turned actually hot
a few days back it must have started the snow melting
at a furious rate. If we get a hard rain now
there&rsquo;ll be a whopping big flood all along the Susquehanna
this spring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems all right around here, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; asked Allan, as he bent down over Giraffe&rsquo;s
fireplace, with the caution of a hunter who knew
how necessary it always is to see that no glowing
embers have been forgotten that a sudden wind
could carry off to cause a disastrous conflagration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Giraffe throw some water over the coals,&rdquo;
remarked Thad. &ldquo;He loves a fire better than anyone
I know, but you never find him neglecting to
take the proper precautions. Yes, it&rsquo;s cold to the
touch. Let&rsquo;s hunt a place to bunk for the night,
Allan. With our blankets, a bed in the soft hay
ought to feel just prime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine of them burrowed into the big haymow,
with all sorts of merry remarks, and a flow of boyish
badinage. Finally they began to get settled
in their various nooks and the talking died down
until in the end no one said a single word, and
already Bumpus and perhaps several others began
to breathe heavily, thus betraying the fact that they
had passed over the border of dreamland.</p>
<p>Thad of course had more to think about than
most of his mates, because, as the patrol leader, and
head of the present expedition, he found problems
to study out that did not present themselves to such
happy-go-lucky fellows as Bumpus, Step Hen,
Davy, and perhaps Giraffe. So Thad lay there for
quite some time, thinking, and trying to lay out
some plan of campaign to be followed in case the
expected rain did strike them before they came up
with the fugitive tramp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>It was very comfortable, and the hay was sweet-smelling,
so that even the fastidious Smithy had
not been heard to utter the least complaint, but had
burrowed with the rest. Possibly he may have
swathed his face, as well as his body, in the folds
of his blanket, in order to prevent any roving spider
from carrying out the gypsy&rsquo;s evil prophecy; but
if so no one knew it, since all of them but Allan
and Thad had made separate burrows.</p>
<p>The young scout master remembered that his
thoughts became confused, and then he lost his
grip on things.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that his dreams must be wonderfully
vivid, for as he suddenly struggled up to
a sitting position he could fancy that he heard some
one calling at the top of his voice. Then shrill
screams in girlish tones added to the clamor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mean, Thad?&rdquo; demanded Allan, as
he clutched the arm of his chum, at the same time
sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Thad shortly. &ldquo;There
must be something wrong up at the farmhouse.
The other fellows are stirring now, so let&rsquo;s crawl
out of this in a big hurry, Allan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both scouts made all haste to escape from the
tunnel under the hay, kicking their way to freedom.
No sooner had they gained their feet than they
started out of the barn, for the haymow was under
the shelter of a roof.</p>
<p>Only too well did Thad know what was the matter,
when he burst from the door of the barn, and
saw that the darkness of the night was split by a
glare from up in the direction of the farmhouse
on the rise. Through the bare branches of the trees
he could see tongues of flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The house is on fire, Allan!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We
must get all the boys out, and do what we can to
fight the flames. Hi! everybody on deck&mdash;Giraffe,
Step Hen, Davy, and the rest of you, hurry out
here and lend a hand! You&rsquo;re wanted, and wanted
badly into the bargain!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">SCOUTS TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>Feeling sure that the rest of the scouts, as
well as Hiram, the overgrown country boy who
worked on the farm, would be along shortly, Thad
and Allan seized upon a couple of buckets, filled
them at the watering trough near by, and hastened
toward the burning building.</p>
<p>The farmer, partly dressed, was doing valiant
work already, and his wife kept up a constant
pounding of the pump, filling buckets as fast as the
man of the house emptied them.</p>
<p>When the two scouts got to work things began
to look more hopeful, though with the flames making
such rapid headway it promised to be a hard
fight to win out.</p>
<p>Thad wondered why the fire should have gained
such a tremendous headway, but later on the mystery
was explained, and he understood the reason.
When kerosene is dashed around it offers splendid
food for fire, once the flame is applied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Now came all of the other fellows, eager to lend
a helping hand. The farmer had been neighborly
and kind, and his folks had helped to make a pleasant
night for their unexpected but nevertheless welcome
guests, and on this account alone Thad and
his chums felt that they must do all in their power
to save the house. Then again they were scouts,
and as such had cheerfully promised to always assist
those in trouble, whether friends, strangers, or
even enemies.</p>
<p>They found all manner of vessels capable of holding
more or less water. Bumpus even manipulated
a footbath, although on one or two occasions he
had to stumble as usual, and came very near being
drowned in consequence, since he deluged himself
from head to foot with the contents.</p>
<p>When such a constant stream of water was being
poured upon the fire it could not make much headway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her going!&rdquo; yelped Giraffe, whose long
legs allowed him to make more frequent trips back
and forth than any of the others; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got her
at a standstill now, and the next thing you know
she&rsquo;ll cave under. More water this way! Everybody&rsquo;s
doing it! Hi! Bumpus, don&rsquo;t upset that ocean
over me; it&rsquo;s the fire that wants putting out, not me.
Whee! look at that, would you; he smothered it
with that deluge. Bully for you, Bumpus! Do it
some more, boy! You&rsquo;re sure a brick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They worked like beavers, every fellow acting as
though the success of the undertaking depended
wholly upon his individual efforts. When the good
woman fell back, completely exhausted with her efforts,
the two girls nobly responded to the call, and
pumped away as only sturdy country lassies could,
filling the buckets that came their way as speedily
as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>It was very lively while it lasted, and none of
those who took part in that midnight battle with
the devouring element would soon forget their exciting
experience.</p>
<p>The fire seemed to be confined to the room in
which it had started, so that the damage would not
be extended, which was one satisfaction at least.</p>
<p>To the boys it was next door to a picnic. They
just gloried in participating in such an exciting
event as this, and some of them may even have felt
a little disappointment because the battle with the
devouring element promised to be of such short
duration, though of course that did not mean
they would have been glad to have seen further
disaster overtake their friend the farmer.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan would not allow anyone to relax
their efforts in the slightest degree, even when
it became positive that they were quickly putting
out the last of the fire. Until every spark had been
properly extinguished there must lie no stoppage to
the good work. A fire is only put out when there
is no longer any danger of its awakening to new
life when one&rsquo;s back is turned.</p>
<p>Finally the work was done, and they could rest
themselves. The man had gone into the kitchen and
started a blaze in the stove there, for the night air
seemed chilly, and none of them was dressed any
too warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this old tramp promises to make a new
record along the line of excitement for our crowd,
and that&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo; declared Step Hen, as he took a
drink of cold water, for his recent exertions had
&ldquo;warmed him up inside,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should remark it did,&rdquo; added Giraffe; &ldquo;and
who can say what lies ahead of us yet? One thing
follows another like a procession. But I&rsquo;m glad we
happened to be here at the right time, so we could
help save the farmhouse. These people have been
mighty kind to us, and it&rsquo;s nice to be able to pay
&rsquo;em back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Thad, I hope now <i>we</i> didn&rsquo;t have anything
to do with that fire?&rdquo; remarked Davy, who lowered
his voice as he spoke, as though unwilling to have
anyone outside of his comrades hear what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon we had a heap to do with extinguishing
the same, anyhow,&rdquo; Giraffe told him;
&ldquo;but what do you mean, Davy? Don&rsquo;t act so mysterious,
but blurt it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t leave any fire where
you cooked supper, Giraffe, that could have been
scooped up by the rising wind, and carried to the
house up here? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s bothering me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it worry you a whit any longer then,&rdquo;
Thad told him promptly; &ldquo;because Allan and I made
sure to examine the fireplace, and we found that
Giraffe, like a true scout, had thrown water on the
last spark. It was cold and dead. So you see,
Davy, we couldn&rsquo;t have had anything to do with
its starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo; asked Smithy, who evidently
did not know that he had a ridiculous long
black smooch down one side of his face, or he would
not have looked so well satisfied, because Smithy
still cared a great deal for his personal appearance,
and sometimes even brushed his hair on the sly
when in camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find that out from the farmer,&rdquo;
said Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>They looked in the kitchen where the owner of
the house had last been seen, but he was not there.
Just then they heard him calling them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in here, boys!&rdquo; he kept saying; and presently
they located the voice as coming from the living
room, where the fire had been confined, thanks
to their energetic labors.</p>
<p>As they pushed in there they saw that it was
pretty much of a wreck; but as the farmer&rsquo;s wife
had already told Thad they were fully insured, the
result would be more of an inconvenience, and the
loss of family treasures, than any great amount of
pecuniary damage.</p>
<p>The farmer was standing at an old desk that
was part bookcase. It had somehow managed to
escape the flames that came upon most of the contents
of the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got my little pile, all right,&rdquo; he started to
say, as the scouts crowded into the damaged and
blackened room, now several inches deep with water;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad it wasn&rsquo;t very much. If this had
happened three weeks ago I&rsquo;d have stood to lose
several thousand dollars, because I sold a patch of
land, and had the cash overnight in this same desk,
though I banked it next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was immediately deeply interested. He
saw in these significant words of the farmer an
explanation of the mystery as to how the fire could
have started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell us that you have been
robbed, sir?&rdquo; he asked; and the old man nodded his
head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I woke up, and thought I heard the low sound
of voices downstairs here,&rdquo; he went on to explain;
&ldquo;so I got out of bed, after waking Nancy, picked
up my gun, and came down the stairs. They creak
like all get-out, and must &rsquo;a&rsquo; told the scamps somebody
was coming. Just as I got to the door I saw
two men by the desk here, that they had forced
open; and I guess they&rsquo;d copped my little roll of
bills about that time. Well, I was struck dumb at
the sight at first, and then I remembered my gun;
but before I could swing it up to my shoulder one
of them swept the lighted lamp from the table to
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flash that came blinded me, and I forgot
all about the robbers in thinking about saving my
house. Then Nancy she came down, and we got
busy. All at once I remembered you boys in the
barn, and Hiram, and I started to yellin&rsquo; at the
top of my voice, but pitchin&rsquo; water all the while.
That&rsquo;s how the fire started, you see; and we&rsquo;re sure
beholdin&rsquo; a heap to you boys for helpin&rsquo; put it out
as smart as we did. It looks tough, for a fact, but
sho! it might &rsquo;a&rsquo; been heaps worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the dog&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye reckon they could have
done to him?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be they pizened Toby,&rdquo; replied the
farmer; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past that tough pair to
do anything. But chances are the dog&rsquo;s off to the
woods huntin&rsquo; rabbits. He often runs away like
that and stays all night long. If I tie him up he
barks enough to set us crazy. I&rsquo;ll have to get rid
of him, and find a better watchdog.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, things are getting warmer right along,
ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Step Hen wanted to know. &ldquo;A fire
was bad enough, but when you find out that it was
started by thieves, and that they actually robbed the
house first, it gets more and more exciting. Now
the Silver Fox Patrol has done something along
lines like that before; and mebbe we might again,
given half a fair chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the two men didn&rsquo;t wait to see what
happened after they had knocked the lamp over,
and the flames shot up?&rdquo; remarked Allan, thoughtfully;
and the farmer was quick to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cleared out in a big hurry, because I didn&rsquo;t
see anything more of the pair,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But
then they got what they came after, and that satisfied
the rascals. And I don&rsquo;t reckon there&rsquo;s a single
chance in ten I&rsquo;ll ever recover that fifty dollars,
barring twenty cents, that I got for the last two
loads of hay I took into town. But then my house
is left, and we&rsquo;ll get some insurance to pay for repairs,
so I&rsquo;m not complaining. There&rsquo;s only one
thing that makes me mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that, Mr. Bailey?&rdquo; asked Davy, deeply
interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I was so stunned at sight of them fellers
robbin&rsquo; my desk I forgot I had an old Civil War
musket in my hands. I had ought to&rsquo;ve let fly,
and knocked one of the pizen critters silly. I&rsquo;ll
never forgive myself for bein&rsquo; so slow to act.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Thad had his own ideas about that. Had the
farmer fired that long-barreled musket at such close
range he would possibly have killed one of the men;
and whether such a tragedy would have been justified
under the circumstances was and must remain
an open question. If his life had been threatened
of course the farmer would have done right to
defend himself to the utmost; but Thad believed
that had it been him he would have allowed the
men to get some distance away before sending a
load of shot at them, his object being to wound
and not slay.</p>
<p>It was certainly good, however, to find that Mr.
Bailey took things so philosophically all around.
Some men would have been bewailing their misfortune,
and never once seeing how much they had
to be thankful for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you would know either or both of
them again if you happened to set eyes on them,
sir?&rdquo; asked the patrol leader, with an object in
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw them faces as plain as I do yours, my
boy,&rdquo; responded the farmer, soberly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m dead
sartin I&rsquo;d know &rsquo;em again. Why&mdash;whatever am I
thinkin&rsquo; about, to be sure? Say, you boys ought
to know that you&rsquo;ve got nigh as much interest in
findin&rsquo; them tramps as I feel. You wonder why I
say that, do you? I&rsquo;ll explain it to you in a jiffy.
Listen then. One of the thieves had red hair, and
he was wearin&rsquo; an old faded blue army coat with
red lining in it. That&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>It seemed as though every one of those eight
scouts drew a deep breath that had the sound of a
sigh. They looked at one another, at first with
wonder in their faces, and then Giraffe was heard
to give vent to what he intended should be a joyous
chuckle. The sound was contagious, for immediately
broad smiles began to appear here and there,
and there was a general hand-shaking as though
the news were deemed important enough to make
them congratulate each other.</p>
<p>It was a fact calculated to make them feel that
the long chase had not been useless, when they
thus learned so suddenly that the man they hunted
had been almost in their power half an hour before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">ON THE RIVER ROAD.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that give you a heart-ache,
now?&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, making a wry face, as he
looked at his seven mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to think of it!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus, &ldquo;we
were all sleeping sweetly like babes in the woods,
out there in the hay, while our game passed us by.
A healthy lot of scouts we seem like, don&rsquo;t we?
When people hear of this they&rsquo;ll vote us a leather
medal. Always on guard, hey? Never letting a
single thing worth while slipping through our fingers?
Oh! my stars, somebody fan me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad laughed at the fat scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t feel so bad if I were you, Bumpus,&rdquo;
he remonstrated; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing on us that I can
see. This happened to be an accident that we
couldn&rsquo;t help. How were we to guess that the man
we came after would drop in here and rob the
farmer? The fortunes of war, Bumpus. Besides,
it gives us a pointer. We know now that Wandering
George isn&rsquo;t far ahead of us; and we&rsquo;re going
to catch up with him before a great while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk, Thad!&rdquo; commented Step
Hen. &ldquo;We never give up when we get started on
a game. Keeping everlastingly at it is what wins
most of all. George was kind to leave his card
behind him; and in the morning we&rsquo;ll start out
fresh on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would appear from this that none of the others
felt at all depressed because of the strange happening;
and realizing this even Bumpus was soon looking
satisfied again. The farmer declared he would
not try to sleep any more that night, but as for the
scouts they could see no reason why anyone else
should follow his example, when that sweet hay
called so loudly.</p>
<p>The consequence was that before long there was
an exodus to the barn, for since the small hours of
the morning had come the air was decidedly cool,
and none of them felt comfortable.</p>
<p>Nothing more developed during the remainder of
that night, and the first thing some of the sleepers
knew they were hearing the bugle sounding the
reveille. Bumpus had been aroused by Allan poking
him in the ribs, and telling him it was sun-up; for
somehow the two had bored into the hay together
the second time.</p>
<p>Giraffe attended to the fire, as usual, and as everybody
wanted to get warm there was no lack of
cooks. The work of the farm had started long
before, and already the girls were coming in with
full buckets of new milk; while the cackling of many
hens announced that the biddies were giving an
account of themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>As the boys gathered around and started to partake
of their breakfast the farmer and his family
poured out of the house bearing all manner of additions
to the menu, even to a couple of apple pies,
which seems to be a standard early morning dish
in the country along the Susquehanna, even as
doughnuts are in New England.</p>
<p>Of course the boys fared like kings, and would
not soon forget that splendid breakfast. When
they packed their kits ready to make a fresh start,
the girls insisted on pressing various little additions
to their larder upon them, so that what with
the apples, cookies, and the like, some of the boys
could hardly manage to strap up their haversacks.</p>
<p>And there was Hiram looking so forlorn over
their going that Thad took pity on the poor fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to remember you, Hiram,&rdquo; he told the
farmhand, as he squeezed his big hand warmly,
&ldquo;and after we get home I&rsquo;ll send you a bunch of
reading matter in connection with this scout movement,
as well as several cracking good books that
have been written covering the activities of our
Silver Fox Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! I hope yeou do that same!&rdquo; ejaculated
Hiram, brightening up; &ldquo;&rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m jest bustin&rsquo; to
larn all about it. I&rsquo;d give a heap if I ever hed a
chanct to wear a suit like them be, an&rsquo; camp out in
the woods. I hearn thar be a troop o&rsquo; scouts
a-formin&rsquo; over in Hicksville, an&rsquo; by jinks I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo;
to put in a application, as sure&rsquo;s my name&rsquo;s Hiram
Spinks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you do, Hiram,&rdquo; the patrol leader told
him, &ldquo;and if I can do anything at any time to help
out, let me know. First of all I&rsquo;m going to mail
you an extra handbook or Boy Scout Manual I&rsquo;ve
got knocking around home; and if you&rsquo;re feeling a
touch of the fever now, that&rsquo;s guaranteed to give
it to you ten times worse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>So they said good-by to the hospitable farmer
and his family, none of whom would accept a single
cent in return for what they had done for the
scouts. Indeed, they vehemently declared they were
heavily in the boys&rsquo; debt on account of their having
helped save the farmhouse after it had been set
on fire by the action of the hobo thieves, surprised
at their work of robbing the farmer&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>Thad had been off somewhere while the rest were
finishing their packing. When he came back Allan,
who noticed the expression on the face of the patrol
leader, guessed he must have met with a certain
amount of success. Apparently he knew what the
other had started out to find; at least his first remark
made it look that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, was it there, Thad?&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As plain as print,&rdquo; came the immediate reply,
accompanied with a smile of satisfaction, such as a
fellow may assume when he is in a position to say
&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, the track of a broken shoe which has
the sole held in place by a rag bound about it, hobo
fashion?&rdquo; continued Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and belonging to the right foot at that, just
as we learned long ago was the case with Wandering
George,&rdquo; Thad continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you run across the trail?&rdquo; questioned
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you when we&rsquo;re leaving here,&rdquo; he was
told. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so plain even a tenderfoot couldn&rsquo;t miss
seeing the same. And when the road is reached
you can follow it for some little distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward the river, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in an easterly direction,&rdquo; answered the
leader of the patrol; &ldquo;and that just suits us right
up to the notch, you know. But the boys are ready
to start, so we&rsquo;d better be hiking out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last they saw of the farmer and his family
the two girls were waving their sun-bonnets wildly,
while the older people contented themselves with
making use of their hands. This little visit of the
scouts had made a very enjoyable break in the
monotony of their lives, and would not be soon
forgotten.</p>
<p>As for Hiram, he had received permission to accompany
the boys for a mile along the road; though
Thad had solemnly promised the farmer to send him
back in due time, for there were daily chores to be
looked after that could not be neglected.</p>
<p>While some of the others, notably Bumpus and
Smithy and Davy, were paying attention to answering
the fervent signals of the jolly country girls,
Thad was showing Allan, Giraffe, Bob White and
Step Hen the plain impression of the marked shoe
belonging, as they very well knew, to the particular
tramp whom they were so anxious to overtake.</p>
<p>How Hiram did listen eagerly to every word
that was uttered, and even got down on his hands
and knees to scrutinize that impression. He had of
course hunted at times, as every country boy does,
and shot his quota of small game like rabbits, squirrels,
quail and woodcock; yet knew next to nothing
concerning the real delights of woodcraft. But the
seed had taken root in Hiram&rsquo;s soul, and would
sprout from that time on. The coming of these
scouts had aroused an ambition within him, and he
could never again be the same contented plodder
that he had seemed to be in the past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Down the road the boys walked at a brisk pace,
chatting and joking as they went on. Those in the
van of course had the task of keeping in touch with
the tracks and every once in a while they made
sure that these could still be discovered in the rather
soft soil alongside the road.</p>
<p>When the mile had been passed and more Thad
reminded Hiram of his promise, and in turn every
scout pressed the big fellow&rsquo;s hard hand warmly.
So they passed out of Hiram&rsquo;s life; but the result
of his meeting these wide-awake scouts was destined
to mark an epoch in the career of that country boy,
a turning point in his destiny as it were.</p>
<p>The day was another gloomy one.</p>
<p>It seemed as though Nature might be frowning
her worst, and giving all sorts of portentous signs
concerning what was coming before long. If anything
the damp feeling in the air had grown more
pronounced than before, which would indicate to a
weather prophet the approach of wet weather.</p>
<p>It takes considerable to dampen the enthusiasm
of lively scouts, however; and as the morning crept
along they continued to make merry as they plodded
on their way.</p>
<p>It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock when a shout from
Giraffe in the front announced a discovery of some
moment. Trust &ldquo;Old Eagle Eye&rdquo; for finding out
things ahead of others; he was not gifted with that
keenness of vision for nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, the river at last?&rdquo; called Bumpus,
between puffs, for the pace was fast enough to
make the stout scout breathe hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, as sure as you live!&rdquo; exclaimed
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let me tell you, suh, she looks mighty fine
to me,&rdquo; remarked Bob White, who was particularly
fond of the water, and a good boatman as well as
canoeist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Strikes me the old Susquehanna must
be on a tear already!&rdquo; came from Bumpus, as he
caught his first glimpse of the wide expanse of
flowing water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty high for a fact!&rdquo; Smithy admitted;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m somewhat familiar with the river, because I
visited here several summers; and I never saw so
much water running down between its banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road they were following, upon drawing
near the river, turned sharply to the south. After
that the boys knew they must be within reaching
distance of the water as long as they kept to that
thoroughfare; though of course should they learn,
through the tracks they followed, that the hobo
wearing the old army coat had taken to a side path
they would be compelled to do the same.</p>
<p>Occasionally they came to an isolated house, and
once passed through a small hamlet; but made sure
to find the trail beyond, showing that Wandering
George had safely navigated through the outpost
of civilization, and not been locked up. In fact,
Thad was of the opinion that the pair of nomads
must have circled around the village on general
principles. After having been discovered in the
act of robbing the farmer&rsquo;s home bank they may
have feared arrest; and while one hid in the thickets
the other possibly ventured into the village in order
to purchase supplies, principally strong drink at the
tavern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>No matter what their tactics may have been,
the pair still held to the river road, and that was
sufficient for the scouts who followed the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it, Thad?&rdquo; asked Giraffe,
after he had seen the leader and Allan closely examining
a pretty fair footprint left by the tramp;
&ldquo;and are we a long ways behind right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t an easy thing to say,&rdquo; he was told, &ldquo;because
we haven&rsquo;t much to go by, you see, and have
to figure it out on general principles; but we&rsquo;ve
concluded that this print is about two hours old;
and that the men are taking it fairly easy as tramps
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every once in so often they stop, and sit down
on a log that looks inviting, as you see they did
here,&rdquo; Allan added, pointing as he spoke. &ldquo;We
figure they must have invested some of the stolen
money in whisky at that village tavern, and that
every time they stop they indulge themselves in a
good swig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what they do, Allan!&rdquo; announced Step
Hen, who had been aimlessly prowling around on
the border of the road back of the log where the
tramps had rested; &ldquo;see here what I&rsquo;ve picked up.
That flask must have held a full pint, and it&rsquo;s been
drained to the last drop. More where that came
from; and chances are before long we may run
across our men sprawled out in the bushes in a
drunken sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as most tramps can soak in any amount
of bug juice without showing signs of it,&rdquo; Giraffe
ventured, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t count too heavy on that
same; though it&rsquo;d be a bully good thing for us, as
we could get back the Judge&rsquo;s blue overcoat without
any row. The question is, ought we to arrest
the hoboes on account of what they did up at
Bailey&rsquo;s farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t cross that river till we come to it,
Giraffe,&rdquo; laughed Thad; but all the same some of
the scouts felt positive their leader had his plan of
campaign mapped out already, because that was his
invariable rule, so as not to be taken unawares.</p>
<p>Another half hour passed. Just ahead of them
was a small cabin between the road and the river.
A fenced-in patch showed where the occupants managed
to have a little garden in season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails that woman standing there and calling
out, d&rsquo;ye suppose?&rdquo; remarked Step Hen, as they
were passing the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to be bothered some, if you can judge
by the way she waves her hands, and keeps on beckoning,&rdquo;
Giraffe went on to say, becoming interested.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s facing out on the river, too, you notice.
Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she&rsquo;s got a cub of
a boy who&rsquo;s gone out further than he ought to
on the swift current in some tub of a boat, and
she&rsquo;s trying to make him come ashore. There,
didn&rsquo;t you hear her yell to Johnny to come back
at once? And here&rsquo;s where the bushes end, so we
can see for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>It turned out that Giraffe was correct, for there
was a makeshift of a boat out on the current of the
river, containing a boy who was clumsily trying
to turn its head in the direction of the shore. The
obstructions in the Susquehanna make it a very
treacherous stream, with eddies and stealthy currents
that take one unawares, and &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo; was
making a sorry mess of his work, Thad saw at a
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s apt to get upset if he doesn&rsquo;t take care!&rdquo;
exclaimed Bob White, who knew the signs all too
well.</p>
<p>The woman kept shouting and no doubt this distracted
the boy more or less, causing him to lose
his head. In fact he did just what he should never
have done; for when the bow of his boat ran up on
a partly submerged rock he let go the oars, picked
one up, and rising to his feet stepped forward to
push the craft off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; shouted Thad, between his hands;
but if the boy heard he gave no sign of obeying,
his one thought being to push his oar against the
obstruction, and get the boat moving free again.</p>
<p>Then came a shriek from the poor mother. The
current had got in its treacherous work, just as
Thad and some of his chums had expected would
be the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone in, and the boat turned turtle!&rdquo; cried
Step Hen, aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! oh! somebody save my poor Johnny, because
he can&rsquo;t swim a stroke!&rdquo; shrieked the woman,
wringing her hands, and appealing to the detachment
of scouts, of whose presence near the spot of
the tragedy she had just become aware.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">USEFUL KNOWLEDGE.</span></h2>
<p>That was a time for rapid action, and not talk.
No one knew this better than the leader of the
Silver Fox Patrol. At the same time, if he wished
to render assistance to the imperiled lad it was
necessary that he give a few quick directions to his
chums, so they could all work together toward
that end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allan, the rest of you hurry along and get below!
Giraffe, back me up, will you? I know what
you can do in cold water. We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to save
that boy, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it. Come along,
Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall scout never hesitated for even a single
second. He understood that it would be necessary
for both of them to plunge into that flood of water,
cold from the melting snows further toward the
source of the river; but Giraffe was known for his
boldness, and a little thing like that could not
frighten him. Why, on one occasion he had plunged
into a burning woods, and performed prodigies of
valor; what was an ice-water bath to him but a little
episode?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Both boys as they hurried toward the brink of
the river commenced to shed their outer garments,
having discarded other impedimenta like their
haversacks the first thing. In this way Thad knew
he would be &ldquo;killing two birds with one stone,&rdquo; for
they must be impeded with clinging clothes when
swimming; and after they came out it was bound
to feel very cold, so that these dry garments must
come in handy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in here, Giraffe, and I&rsquo;ll drop down a
little further!&rdquo; he shouted, as the two of them
came upon the river bank.</p>
<p>A quick look out on the rolling current had shown
him how affairs stood just then. He saw that the
frantic boy was clinging to the overturned boat,
which was swirling around in the eddies, and swinging
downstream at quite a rapid rate. He lost his
grip even as Thad looked, and the heart of the
scout seemed to leap into his throat with dread.
Then the boy somehow managed to regain his hold,
but he seemed to be so excited and frightened that
there was danger of his slipping away again at any
second; and being weakened by exposure the
chances of his once more recovering his slender
hold could not be worth much.</p>
<p>Thad did not waste a single second. He was
hurrying along even when taking this look toward
the scene of the catastrophe and figuring just where
to jump into the water at the same time.</p>
<p>In deciding this he had to take into consideration
the length of time that might ensue before he
could expect to push out to where the overturned
boat was going to pass; also the strength of the
current that was bringing the wreck down toward
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Although the water felt like ice when he started
in Thad did not allow that fact to bother him a
particle. He shot a glance upstream, and saw that
already Giraffe had reached deep water so that he
was compelled to swim. The sight of him buffeting
the waves gave Thad considerable satisfaction;
though he feared that the boy clinging to the slippery
bottom of the boat might disappear before
either of the intended rescuers could reach him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other six scouts had started on a
run down the road, it being the intention of Allan
to have them where they could render assistance
in getting the others ashore, because those in the
water would likely be exhausted, even if all went
well.</p>
<p>Then Thad reached a &ldquo;step-off&rdquo; and plunging in
over his head was compelled to swim for it, which
he did right valiantly, constantly keeping tabs on
the oncoming boat, and still hoping that the boy
might maintain his hold until either Giraffe or himself
could lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>All at once he felt a chill that was not caused by
the icy water, for the poor fellow had again slipped
back into the churning water. But Thad and
Giraffe were closing in on him, with the latter in a
position to glimpse the still struggling lad ere he
finally went down.</p>
<p>With the crisis upon him Thad dived, while
Giraffe started to tread water, and hold himself in
readiness to help should his chum meet with any
success. It seemed an interminable time to the
lengthy scout before he saw Thad reappear. At
first he feared the patrol leader must have missed
connections with the drowning boy; and then he
made the pleasing discovery to the contrary, for
Thad was gripping Johnny tightly with one arm,
as he swam with the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Giraffe shot toward him as fast as he could go,
and in another moment the two scouts were putting
into practice something that all scouts learn as a part
of their preparedness, when trying to rescue a comrade
who has been seized with a cramp while swimming&mdash;holding
the unconscious lad between them,
with his head kept well above the water, they started
toward the bank, swimming with sturdy and well-regulated
strokes.</p>
<p>When they drew near enough for one of the
others who had waded in up to his waist to reach
out a hand, it came easier; and in this way they
bore the rescued boy ashore.</p>
<p>Thad was already shivering with the cold, but
he kept his wits about him, and gave such orders
as he saw were necessary.</p>
<p>Allan and several of the other scouts were directed
to try and resuscitate the apparently drowned
boy; while Bumpus and Smithy started as big a
fire as they could manage, so that all of them might
warm up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Thad and Giraffe jumped around, and
slapped their arms furiously in the endeavor to get
up a good circulation of blood.</p>
<p>The poor woman came upon them at this unfortunate
moment, while Allan kneeling over the wet
form of her boy was kneading his chest after the
most approved fashion known to life-savers; and a
couple of the other fellows were working his arms
back and forth above his head as though they
gripped pump-handles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s dead, my boy Johnny is dead!&rdquo; wailed
the mother, starting to throw herself upon the
group; when Bob White, although full of sympathy
for her harrowed feelings, knew that to stop the
proceedings just then might end what hope there
existed for saving a life.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he caught her in his arms, and insisted
in restraining her, at the same time speaking
words of hope and cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t interfere with them, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he
told her soothingly; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got the water out of
his lungs, and are trying to start artificial breathing
by pumping him that way. There&rsquo;s lots of hope
he&rsquo;ll come out all right, because he wasn&rsquo;t under the
water long. Why, I believe I saw his eyelid flutter
right then. Yes, suh, it did the same again. It&rsquo;s
a fact, and you&rsquo;re bringing him along handsomely,
fellows. So you see, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;re not going to
lose Johnny after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman knelt there, awed, and watched the
slow recovery of her boy. After a little while he
began to breathe naturally; then his eyes opened,
and he even made an effort to struggle, possibly
being still impressed with the horror of his recent
peril.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Before that time the fire had got to burning splendidly,
and both boys who had been in the river
crowded as close to the warmth as possible, feeling
much better on account of it. Thad, too, could
think again, and direct his chums what to do. One
of them ran to the cabin and came back with a
blanket, which was wrapped around the now recovered
but shivering Johnny; after which Step
Hen and Allan assisted the small boy to reach his
home, with the rejoicing mother following at their
heels, crying now, but with happiness.</p>
<p>Allan told her just what to do in order that no
ill effect, such as pneumonia, should follow the
immersion, and she promised to keep him in bed,
and give him warm liquid food until he was feeling
himself again.</p>
<p>When the two scouts turned to leave her the poor
woman kissed them both, much to their confusion;
for they felt that the thanks were due to Thad and
Giraffe, if anybody, since they were the ones who
had risked something in order to save the drowning
boy.</p>
<p>Of course this was going to detain them for perhaps
an hour, because those who had been in the
water wished to thoroughly dry their clothes, at
least such as they had taken with them into the
river.</p>
<p>Both had been wise enough to tear off leggins and
shoes before leaving the shore, as swimming would
have been next to impossible otherwise; and this
counted considerably in their favor now.</p>
<p>While they sat around the blaze, waiting until
Thad gave the signal for another start, the boys
thought it wise to make their noonday meal, so they
would not have to stop again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Of course the talk was pretty much all upon the
subject of rescuing persons who were in danger of
being drowned; and also of resuscitating those who
had been pulled out of the water apparently far
gone.</p>
<p>Thad, as usual, did not let the chance slip to deliver
a few telling remarks connected with a knowledge
of certain kinds which all scouts are required
to attain before they can become shining lights in
the profession, or hope to rise to the position of
second or first class scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one splendid thing this scout business
has done for boys above another,&rdquo; he went on to
say, as they sat around the fire, &ldquo;I think it is the
fact that every tenderfoot has to learn how to swim
during his first season in camp. How many thousands
of lives might have been saved in the past
if all boys over eight years of age had been taught
how to keep themselves afloat in the water. If
the movement had never done a single thing more
than that it would deserve to be reckoned the finest
thing that ever happened for American youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Giraffe went on to add, &ldquo;and think how
many a fellow has been saved from drowning, just
as little Johnny here was, first by being taken from
the water, and then in having the spark of life
coaxed back. You worked that as fine as anything
I ever saw, Allan, and the rest of you. Thad and
me felt so shivery cold I&rsquo;m afraid we couldn&rsquo;t have
done it alone by ourselves. A whole lot of the
credit goes to the rest of you, and we want you to
know that. It was a patrol rescue, and something
the boys of the Silver Fox can be proud of always.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>That was just like Giraffe, who could be one of
the most generous-hearted fellows ever known when
he wanted to. That he felt considerable remorse
because of his reckless way of sending poor Bumpus
into that field with the angry mother cow
had been patent to Thad early that morning, when
he saw Giraffe asking Bumpus to lean on him, after
the stout scout had mentioned the fact that he was
feeling somewhat stiff following his unusual exertions
of the previous day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to my notion,&rdquo; Step Hen broke in
with, &ldquo;no boy should ever be allowed to go out in
a boat on the water unless he knows how to swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you there, Step Hen,&rdquo; the patrol
leader added; &ldquo;and yet how often you see boys
taking the greatest kind of chances, when if an
upset comes along they&rsquo;re as helpless as babies.
That mother has learned a lesson; and chances are
Johnny never goes in a boat again till he can swim
like a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But boys are not the only ones who take such
chances,&rdquo; Allan argued; &ldquo;why, in the days gone by
when nearly all ships were sailing vessels, and not
steamers, it wasn&rsquo;t a strange thing to find dozens
of old jack tars who had spent their whole lives
at sea, and yet never swam a stroke. It seems queer,
and hard to believe, but I&rsquo;ve heard men tell that
who knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are going to be different after this,
then,&rdquo; said Davy, &ldquo;because every Boy Scout has got
to learn how to swim, or he&rsquo;ll stay a tenderfoot all
his days; and no one wants to do that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to the boat; none of you thought
to rescue that at the same time?&rdquo; Smithy wanted
to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it wasn&rsquo;t worth saving,&rdquo; Giraffe told him;
&ldquo;and after what happened, Johnny&rsquo;s mother would
never want to see it again. We had our hands too
full getting him to the bank to bother about that
cranky old junk. It&rsquo;ll bring up somewhere below,
like as not, or else float out on the Chesapeake Bay
around Havre de Grace, where they used to have
such great duck shooting years ago, because of
the wild celery beds that grew there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was fond of hunting, and knew considerable
in connection with his favorite sport,
which information he delighted to impart to his
chums at divers times and on sundry occasions.
Once upon a time he had been like most thoughtless
boys, so intent on filling his gamebag, or catching
a record number of fish, that slaughter counted
little with him; but after joining the troop Giraffe
had learned what a true sportsman should be, and
since then was never known to inflict needless pain,
or destroy game or game fish when they could not
be used for food.</p>
<p>These numerous useful things which scouts learn
have the knack of curbing the half savage instinct
that seems to repose within nearly all boys&rsquo; breasts;
and which they say must have descended to them
from far-back ancestors.</p>
<p>By the time lunch had been dispatched Thad and
Giraffe declared they were as good as new again,
since every particle of their clothes had been thoroughly
dried. There was a general scrutiny on the
part of all hands, so as to make sure nothing had
been forgotten in the excitement. Thad had sent
several of them back over the ground, to pick up
every object thrown aside in that mad scramble,
from guns and knapsacks to clothes and shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Outside of a little delay, which they expected
would not matter much, they had not suffered in
the least because of this sudden and unexpected
call upon their services. And to have saved a human
life was certainly worth ten times as much
as they had done.</p>
<p>Bumpus at a signal from the leader sounded his
bugle, and once more the little detachment of khaki-clad
boys started along the river road, headed southeast,
and with a positive assurance that the man
whom they sought, the hobo wearing the old blue
army overcoat, was somewhere ahead of them.</p>
<p>In this manner they tramped for several miles,
constantly on the lookout for any signs of their
quarry. Thad frequently searched for the marked
footprint, and as often discovered it plainly marked
in the yielding mud close to the road; so that they
had no fear of overlapping the fugitive.</p>
<p>It was about this time that Bumpus was heard
grumbling to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now, Bumpus; want a little help
on account of that stiff leg?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, turning
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint that,&rdquo; returned the other quickly, as if
scorning to show signs of fatigue when the others
were capable of keeping up the pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you grunting about, then, tell
us?&rdquo; demanded Step Hen, who was himself limping
a little, because of a pebble that had managed to
work into his shoe despite the protecting legging,
and hurt his foot before he bothered getting it
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; began Bumpus na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
started to rain at last, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">ANY PORT IN A STORM.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Bumpus, who&rsquo;s made a first discovery!&rdquo;
exclaimed Giraffe, pretending to show
great enthusiasm by waving his campaign hat about
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s anything to laugh at,&rdquo;
Smithy was heard to remark, with a lugubrious
expression on his face; &ldquo;if it comes down on us
while we&rsquo;re on the tramp, and without any sort of
protection, we&rsquo;ll soon be all mussed up, and in a
nice pickle. I&rsquo;d be considerably better pleased to
have Bumpus discover the sun peeping out at us before
setting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t be cured must be endured, you know,
Smithy,&rdquo; Thad told the former dandy of the troop,
who was every now and then showing traces of his
old faults, though he had been cured of numerous
shortcomings. &ldquo;If it rains we&rsquo;ll have to get our
rubber ponchos over our shoulders, and then look
for a place to spend the night. Things are never
so bad but what you&rsquo;ll find they could be worse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>That indeed was the whole secret of Thad&rsquo;s success,
and the cheerful spirit he invariably displayed
when up against difficulties; and every boy who
makes up his mind to look at his troubles in the
same hopeful spirit will surely profit from such a
course. Things are <i>never</i> at their worst, though
we may temporarily think so. The few drops that
came down did not last and as the scouts continued
to push along the river road they kept their eyes on
the watch for some valley farm, where they might
possibly find shelter against the coming storm.</p>
<p>It began to look as though they must have struck
a portion of the country where, for some unknown
reason, farms were few and far between, which is
not often the case along the picturesque Susquehanna,
since most of the land is under some kind
of cultivation.</p>
<p>Thad even began to fear that as the evening was
now close at hand they might be compelled to abandon
their hope of finding a house, and use the little
time remaining in building some sort of rude shelter.</p>
<p>The idea did not appeal very strongly to him,
because he knew that if a heavy downpour came
upon them it might last for twenty-four hours; and
such a primitive camp would prove a dismal refuge
indeed, with no fire to cheer them, and dripping
trees all around, not to speak of a rapidly rising
river.</p>
<p>On this account he was determined to keep pushing
on until the darkness became too dense to allow
further progress. When they found themselves up
against such a snag as this it would be time to consider
the last resort, which must consist of shelter
under some outcropping rocks, or a rustic hangout
made of branches and every other sort of thing
available.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>The boys were not talking so much latterly. It
seemed as though they might be feeling too tired
for merriment, or else the increasing gravity of
their situation began to impress them.</p>
<p>One thing Thad regretted very much. This was
the fact that after the rain had come and gone they
could hardly expect to follow the man who wore
the old blue army coat by means of the tracks he
left behind him, for these would have been utterly
obliterated. They must then depend on information
given by the inmates of such houses as
they came upon along the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure commencing to get dark, Thad,&rdquo; grumbled
Giraffe, after a while, as if to explain why he
had stubbed his toe, when by rights all that clumsy
business was supposed to be monopolized by poor
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s partly because we happen to be passing
under a big patch of woods here on the right,&rdquo; the
patrol leader explained; &ldquo;which helps to shut out
more or less of the light from the west. Over there
across the river the sky is so gloomy you couldn&rsquo;t
expect it to help out any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But inside of half an hour at the most it&rsquo;ll be
so black you can&rsquo;t see a hand before your face,&rdquo;
Step Hen observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean we ought to be thinking
of stopping,&rdquo; Thad returned, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m of the same
mind; but I hate to give up the hope of striking
some farm, where we could get another chance to
sleep in the haymow. But give me ten minutes
more, boys, and if we fail to strike what we want
I&rsquo;ll call a halt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I&rsquo;ve got a hunch we&rsquo;re going to run
up against an experience before long that we won&rsquo;t
forget in a hurry, either!&rdquo; volunteered Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, none of that croaking, Davy Jones!&rdquo;
cried Bob White. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all been through so
much that it doesn&rsquo;t become any member of the
Silver Fox Patrol to show the white feather, suh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s thinking of doing that same, Bob
White,&rdquo; retorted Davy; &ldquo;I was only trying to figure
out what sort of a night we had ahead of us.
If it comes to knocking up against trouble, I reckon
I&rsquo;m as able to hold up my end of the log as the next
one. My record will prove that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in the same boat, Davy,&rdquo; Step Hen
told him, in order to &ldquo;smooth his ruffled feathers,&rdquo;
as he called it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll time you on that promise, Thad,&rdquo; remarked
Allan, as he took out his little nickel watch,
and held it close up to his face in order to see where
the hands pointed, which action in itself proved the
contention of Giraffe that the daylight was certainly
growing quite dim.</p>
<p>They continued to plod along, now and then some
one making a remark, and all of them looking continually
to the right, in hopes that they might discover
a haven of refuge in the shape of some sort
of house, they cared little how unpretentious it
might be.</p>
<p>Indeed, just then there was not one scout present
but who would have hailed the appearance of
even an old abandoned shanty having a leaky roof
with delight; for with their ingenuity a worn-out
roof could easily be made to shed rain; and a supply
of firewood was to be gathered in a hurry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>The formation of the country was not favorable
in one respect, and they failed to run across anything
in the shape of an outcropping ledge, under
which they might find shelter. This had saved
them from a ducking on more than one former
occasion, as they well remembered; but fortune
was not so kind to-day.</p>
<p>Minute after minute dragged on.</p>
<p>Once Allan even took out his watch, and examined
its face, only to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beats all how you get fooled when you&rsquo;re counting
the minutes,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we haven&rsquo;t been walking that ten
Thad allowed us?&rdquo; asked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just six to the dot, boys,&rdquo; the timekeeper told
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! dear, I thought it was closer on half an
hour,&rdquo; sighed Bumpus, who was dragging his feet
along as though each one weighed a ton. &ldquo;Four
whole minutes left! But Allan, mebbe that watch
of yours has stopped! I had one that used to play
tricks like that on me, &rsquo;specially in the mornings,
when by rights I ought to have been out of bed. It
was the most accommodating thing you ever saw;
I&rsquo;d wake up, take a look and see it stood at a quarter
to seven, and then roll over for another little
snooze. Then I&rsquo;d look again after a while, and
see it was still a quarter to seven, which allowed
me to have another nap. And when my dad came
up to ask me if I was sick, I&rsquo;d tell him he&rsquo;d have
to get me a better watch than that if he expected
me to rise promptly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he?&rdquo; asked Davy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Bumpus shrugged his fat shoulders as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I climb out of bed every morning now when a
great big alarm clock rattles away close to my ear.
Dad sets it there before he retires, and I can&rsquo;t chuck
it out of the window, either. So you see watches
go back on their best friends sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mine is running like a steam engine right
now,&rdquo; Allan remarked, &ldquo;and the four minutes are
nearly down to three. Keep a stiff upper lip,
Bumpus, and the day&rsquo;s hike will soon be over, no
matter what the night brings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the thing that bothered them all, for
the night was setting in so gloomily that it filled
their hearts with secret misgivings and forebodings.
The lonesomeness of their surroundings had something
to do with this feeling, perhaps, although
these boys were used to camping out, and had indeed
roughed it many times in far-distant regions,
where wild beasts roamed, and made the night
hideous with their tongues.</p>
<p>At least nothing of that kind might be expected
here along the peaceful Susquehanna. Their sufferings
were apt to come mostly from the severity
of the weather, and their unpreparedness to meet
a storm such as now threatened.</p>
<p>The three minutes had certainly dwindled to two,
and might be even approaching the last figure to
which their progress was limited, when suddenly
Giraffe gave a shout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We win, boys!&rdquo; was the burden of his announcement;
&ldquo;because, as sure as you live, I
glimpsed a light ahead there. Look, you can see it
easy enough now. We&rsquo;re going to have a roof
over our heads to-night, after all! What a lucky
thing it was you said <i>ten</i> minutes, Thad. Suppose,
now, you&rsquo;d just notched it off with five, why, we&rsquo;d
have missed connections, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hold on, Giraffe, don&rsquo;t you see that light&rsquo;s
on the wrong side of the road,&rdquo; remonstrated Allan.
&ldquo;It ought to be on the right, but instead it
lies close to the edge of the water. Now, no man
would be silly enough to build his farmhouse on
the river bank, where any spring rise might wash
it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a boat of some kind!&rdquo; Thad now declared;
&ldquo;yes, I can begin to get a glimpse of the
same through that thin screen of bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! looks like a houseboat to me, boys, or
what out on the Ohio and the Mississippi they call
a shanty boat, which is a cabin built on a monitor or
float!&rdquo; was what Step Hen announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right there, Step Hen,&rdquo; Allan
put in; &ldquo;but no matter, any port in a storm; and
when a crowd of scouts are hard pushed they can
squeeze in small quarters. We&rsquo;ll fix it somehow
with the owner of that craft to let us pile in with
him till the clouds roll by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All sorts of loud remarks followed, as the party
hastened their footsteps, some of the boys even
laughing, for the improved prospects made Bumpus
and Smithy temporarily forget their troubles.</p>
<p>All of them quickly saw that the object of their
attention was really a clumsy-looking houseboat.
It seemed to be moored to the bank with a stout
rope, and, judging from the fact that a light shone
from a small window, it must be occupied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Laughing and jostling one another, the eight
boys pushed on. It was not so dark as yet but what
they could have been seen after passing the screen
of leafless bushes, had any one chanced to look out
of that window.</p>
<p>Thad led the way aboard. No dog barked, nor
did they hear any sort of a sound inside the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give &rsquo;em a knock, Thad!&rdquo; said Step Hen.</p>
<p>This the patrol leader did, but there was no reply.
Thad waited half a minute, and, hearing nothing,
once more rapped his knuckles on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All asleep, or else up the road somewhere;
s&rsquo;pose you open the door yourself, Thad!&rdquo; suggested
Giraffe impatiently.</p>
<p>When he had knocked a third time, and received
no reply, Thad proceeded to open the cabin door,
after which the rest of the scouts were so eager
to enter that he was actually pushed ahead of them
into the place.</p>
<p>They stared around in bewilderment, for while
a small lamp was burning on a table screwed to
the wall on hinges, and some supper was cooking
on a small stove, there did not seem to be the first
sign of any human presence. There was something
so strange and uncanny about this that the scouts
looked at one another uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">THE DESERTED SHANTY BOAT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody home, Thad!&rdquo; remarked Giraffe presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way,&rdquo; admitted the patrol leader,
for the light of the little lamp allowed them to see
every part of the interior; and some of the scouts
had even bent down to look under the table, and
behind an old trunk, without result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s stepped out to go on an errand down the
road, where there may be some sort of a house, it
looks queer to me that he&rsquo;d leave his supper cooking
on the stove here,&rdquo; and as Allan said this he
pushed back a frying pan that seemed to contain
fried potatoes so nearly done they would have
started to burn in a few more minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! don&rsquo;t this mystery beat everything!&rdquo;
Bumpus was heard to mutter; and since the stout
scout seldom expressed himself forcibly it could
easily be understood that he was now well worked
up; at the same time he warmed his hands by the
fire, and even stooped down to take a closer whiff
of the cooking food which must have appealed irresistibly
to a hungry scout, who was also reckoned
a champion feeder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d better be hurrying back, then,&rdquo; Step Hen
interposed, &ldquo;if he don&rsquo;t want to get his jacket wet,
because she&rsquo;s started in to rain, boys, you hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, they caught the increasing patter
of descending drops on the roof of the cabin, showing
that the long-delayed storm had broken bounds
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woof! talk to me about luck, we&rsquo;ve got it in
big chunks,&rdquo; said Giraffe, grinning, as he relieved
himself of his haversack, and immediately began
to open the same, as though bent on considering
their own supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind of the storm,&rdquo; said Smithy; &ldquo;it held
off until we had run upon this haven of refuge. I
hope now the owner will allow us to stay with him
over night, for it would break my heart to have to
step out of this comfortable place into the nasty
wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Smithy,&rdquo; asserted Giraffe; &ldquo;it&rsquo;d
have to be a charge of dynamite that&rsquo;d hoist me
out of this. Possession is nine points of the law,
they say; and we&rsquo;re here to stay, even if we have
to pay three prices for accommodations. And I
want to tell you that with that jolly fire so handy
we&rsquo;ll be silly to delay getting our own supper
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with what is on the stove,&rdquo; warned
Thad; &ldquo;only shove it back, for when the owner of
the boat does come home he&rsquo;ll want it. Plenty of
room for our purpose, isn&rsquo;t there, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>They assured him on this point, and then both
Giraffe and Bumpus busied themselves. The contents
of the various haversacks soon disclosed a
quantity of eatables, and the cooking of supper was
deemed a &ldquo;snap&rdquo; by those in charge, since they had
the rare privilege of doing their work on a real
stove, with plenty of wood handy.</p>
<p>Let the rain beat upon the roof overhead, until
it made such a racket they had at times to fairly
shout in order to be heard&mdash;who cared, with a cabin
to shield them from the fury of the storm?</p>
<p>Thad hardly anticipated that the absent owner
of the boat would return while the rain was coming
down in such torrents, though if it relaxed its
violence later on they might expect to see him.
Some of the other boys did not have quite so much
confidence, for whenever there was a sudden movement
of the boat, as some gust of wind struck the
upper end, the more nervous ones would hastily
glance toward the door, as though half expecting to
see it thrown open, and an angry boatman push in,
demanding to know what they meant by taking possession
during his absence.</p>
<p>But supper was cooked and placed upon the table
without any interruption of this sort taking place.
There was not room for them all to gather around
the table; indeed, they filled the small cabin pretty
well, eight of them in space that was really intended
for two or three; but that did not interfere
with everyone getting his share of food, though he
had to sit cross-legged like a Turk on the floor to
devour it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>All of them were in fairly high spirits now. The
solving of the problem as to where they were to find
shelter from the storm did considerable to lift them
to this plane. Then again the enjoyment they found
in satisfying their hunger with good things had
its share, as well as the warmth of the cabin, which
was certainly a feature worth considering.</p>
<p>Supper done, and still no let-up to the downfall
of rain, which was beating the liveliest kind of a
tattoo upon the roof. Thad was glad to discover
no signs of a leak anywhere, which spoke well for
the tidiness of the owner.</p>
<p>Giraffe, noticing how Thad looked up and
around, must have guessed what the other was
thinking about, to judge from the remark he made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use talking, Thad, the chap who owns this
boat can&rsquo;t be that Irishman who when some one
asked him why he didn&rsquo;t mend his leaky roof said
that when the weather was dry he didn&rsquo;t think to
bother with it; and when it rained why he couldn&rsquo;t
mend it. This one is as tight as a drum. We&rsquo;re
a lucky lot of scouts again; and I&rsquo;m only sorry that
the mysterious owner isn&rsquo;t here to enjoy the hospitality
of the shanty boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once Thad walked over to the door, which he
found could be secured inside with a bar. It also
had a padlock on the outside, showing that it might
be the habit of the owner when he left his home for
a time to fasten it securely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that padlock wasn&rsquo;t in use when we
struck here,&rdquo; remarked Allan, who had followed the
leader over. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have been compelled to break
in, and that&rsquo;s a serious offense against the law, if
you&rsquo;re caught, though we&rsquo;d have left money to pay
for our housing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Thad opened the door, and they looked out into
the pitch darkness of the night, though neither of
them essayed to step beyond the sill. The storm
was now in full blast, and the river seemed to be
rushing past the moored shanty boat with foam on
the little waves formed by the sweeping wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks pretty ugly, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never would have believed the Susquehanna
could get on such a rampage as this,&rdquo; Allan remarked
in turn. &ldquo;I always had an idea it was a
peaceful sort of river, with beautiful banks, and the
canal running along in places parallel to the river;
but I declare you&rsquo;d think it was the big Mississippi
right now, what we can see of it, from the way our
light shines on the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the boom, you know,&rdquo; Thad told him,
&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s an unusual amount of water in the
channel; but from the way the rain&rsquo;s coming down
it&rsquo;ll be a flood before twenty-four hours, if ever
there was one along here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky we struck a boat then, instead of some
shanty close to the bank; because in that case, Thad,
we might have been washed away before morning,
as the river kept on rising a foot an hour perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad closed the door again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks a whole lot better inside than out,&rdquo; he observed,
&ldquo;which makes me feel glad we&rsquo;re not cowering
under a branch shelter, and taking a ducking.
Even with the rubber blankets we couldn&rsquo;t expect to
keep half way dry when it&rsquo;s pelting down as steady
as that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out what happened
here,&rdquo; said Allan. &ldquo;There was some man in this
cabin, and he was getting supper when we gave
that first shout. Now, it might be he looked out,
and glimpsing a bunch of fellows in khaki suits and
carrying guns, running this way, he thought we
were soldiers. He may have had some good reason
for not wanting to meet up with the State troops,
and so cut and ran for it. That&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;ve
made my mind up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And according to my way of thinking you&rsquo;re
close to the truth, Allan,&rdquo; he was told by the patrol
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that you dropped that bar in place,
Thad, after you&rsquo;d shut the door; what was the idea
of doing that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be just the right thing,
fastening a man&rsquo;s own door against him,&rdquo; laughed
the other; &ldquo;but as we all want to get some sleep
to-night, being tired, I thought it might be best to
fix things so we&rsquo;d have ample warning if the owner
of the boat did turn up. Let him knock, and we&rsquo;ll
be only too glad to open up; only we don&rsquo;t want
him to walk in on us and catch us napping. There&rsquo;s
no telling how unpleasant he might make it for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sound reasoning appealed favorably to Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The window you see has got a stout iron bar
across it,&rdquo; he went on to say; &ldquo;and a fellow would
have the time of his life trying to crawl through
such a small space; so it&rsquo;s all right; we can lie down
to sleep without worrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in fact pretty well played out, having
been up a good part of the previous night, it will
be remembered, and the day&rsquo;s tramp had been anything
but a picnic to certain members of the party
who need not be mentioned by name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Accordingly, about an hour after they had finished
supper there began to be a movement on foot
looking to finding accommodations for spreading
blankets on the hard floor of the cabin.</p>
<p>Space was somewhat at a premium, since there
were eight of the scouts. The owner of the shanty
boat had some sort of contraption in the way of a
cot which in the daytime could be fastened up
against the wall, and in this manner avoid taking
up a considerable amount of space, to be dropped
when needed. None of the boys considered for a
moment using that cot, all of them preferring to
make sure of the protection of their own clean
blankets on the floor.</p>
<p>Bumpus, while very tired, was afraid that he
might not get to sleep as easily as he would have
liked, because of the way his mind was worked
up. Giraffe, in talking about matters, had happened
to suggest that possibly the man owning the boat
may have been seized with a fit when he was stooping
over to draw some water from the river in a
bucket, and had fallen overboard; and the thought
of such a terrible thing happening filled the mind
of tender-hearted Bumpus, who never liked to see
anyone suffer if he could help it.</p>
<p>But although the roar of the storm and the dash
of the waves against the side of the boat, causing it
to rock from time to time, bothered some of the
scouts in the beginning, they finally grew more accustomed
to the chorus of sounds, and in the end
all of them slept as only exhausted boys may.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Thad had remained awake after the last of his
chums yielded to the drowsy feeling that overcame
them; but finally he, too, found forgetfulness in
sleep.</p>
<p>He was aroused by some one clutching him desperately,
and realized that Giraffe, who chanced to
have lain down alongside the leader, was calling his
name wildly.</p>
<p>All was darkness around them, for they had seen
fit to put out the little lamp, wishing to save the
oil as much as possible. The bellowing storm still
held full sway without, and while there had been
no thunder and lightning, as must have been the
case had it happened in midsummer, the forces of
Nature were fiercely contending, and combined to
make a terrible noise.</p>
<p>But Thad immediately became aware of the fact
that there was a new motion to the shanty boat on
which they had found such welcome refuge. It
rocked violently, and pitched very much after the
manner of a bucking broncho trying to unseat a
rider.</p>
<p>Thad could give a quick guess what this signified,
though it chilled him to the very marrow to
realize the new horror that had come upon them.</p>
<p>The other boys were all aroused by now, even
Bumpus, who usually had to be rolled violently before
he would open his eyes; and their various exclamations
of alarm began to be heard all around
him in the gloom of the cabin interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! just feel the old boat jumping, would
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to be seasick already!&rdquo; complained
Smithy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, what d&rsquo;ye think, has she broken away
from her moorings?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe; and the
anxious listeners felt a shock when they heard the
patrol leader reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s happened, boys,
and that we&rsquo;re adrift on the flood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">ADRIFT ON THE FLOOD.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do, Thad?&rdquo; cried Bumpus, as a
lurch of the boat caused him to bang up against
some of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, don&rsquo;t smash me against the side of the
cabin, you elephant!&rdquo; roared Davy, who had been
unfortunate enough to serve as a buffer for the
stout scout.</p>
<p>Thad struck a match, and somehow even the
small glow thus afforded seemed to give the boys
new cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness the tin lamp hasn&rsquo;t been
knocked over and the glass broken!&rdquo; said Step Hen,
as he reached out, and just saved the article in
question from slipping off the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me put this match to the wick,&rdquo; said
Thad; &ldquo;things won&rsquo;t seem quite so bad then as in
the pitch dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they fixed it so the precious tin lamp
could not be spilled; and so long as the oil held
out they meant to keep it burning.</p>
<p>When the door was opened so that they could
look out, it was a dreadful sight the scouts saw. All
before them lay heaving water, that had a sickening
motion to it, but did not seem to be rushing
past as they had noticed it do before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the old river&rsquo;s standing still, I do declare!&rdquo;
cried the astonished Bumpus, as he thrust
his head out of the open doorway to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way because we&rsquo;re moving along
with it, Bumpus,&rdquo; Giraffe told him; ordinarily the
tall scout would most likely have jeered scornfully
at the innocent for suspecting such a thing, but
now he seemed to feel that he owed Bumpus a debt
on account of the trick he had played, which could
only be paid by his being unusually kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do anything, Thad?&rdquo; demanded Step
Hen. &ldquo;Is there a push pole on board so some of us
might start the old tub back to the bank again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one, but it seems to be broken, and
wouldn&rsquo;t be worth a continental cent in all this
flood,&rdquo; Thad told him. &ldquo;Unless we feel desperate
enough to jump over and try to swim for it, we&rsquo;ll
have to stay aboard, and take our chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope now you won&rsquo;t decide to try that!&rdquo;
said Bumpus, whose failings were well known to
his chums, and a lack of the knowledge pertaining
to the art of swimming happened to be one of them.</p>
<p>Indeed, when they looked at that terrible water
all of the scouts shrank back, and not a single voice
was raised in favor of the plan. There might be
worse things even than finding themselves adrift
on the flood in a houseboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that thick rope broke under the
strain, Thad?&rdquo; asked Allan presently, as they still
stood there, looking out, not liking to close the door
lest something terrible happen to the boat, and all
of them be caught in the cabin to drown like rats
in a trap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what must have happened, Allan, though
when I looked it over I thought it could stand any
sort of strain. But it must have been part rotten
in some part; and a rope&rsquo;s like a chain, you know,
only as strong as its weakest link or strand. But
no matter what the cause may have been, all we
have to think of is the effect. It&rsquo;s too late to prevent
the accident; and we&rsquo;ll hope the worst isn&rsquo;t
going to happen to us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean by the worst, Thad?&rdquo; asked
Bumpus, almost piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This river, you know, is full of rocks,&rdquo; explained
the other. &ldquo;In the summertime when the
water&rsquo;s low they stick up everywhere; but in case
of a flood most of them are under water, and act
like snags to punch holes in boats that may be unlucky
enough to be caught afloat. Then again
there&rsquo;s always danger of being crowded up on a
sliding shelf of rock, when the wind and the sweep
of the current might upset us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that last exclamation Bumpus remained
silent, but he certainly found plenty of food for
thought in what he had heard Thad say. Every
new lurch of the boat was apt to give him a fresh
quiver of anxiety. He kept his eyes fixed on Thad,
just as though he believed that if they were to be
saved at all, it must inevitably be through the instrumentality
of the patrol leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>It might readily be assumed that none of those
eight scouts would ever forget that wild voyage
down the flooded Susquehanna, in the inky darkness
of that Spring night. The floating shanty boat
kept performing all manner of remarkable gyrations
under the influence of wind and waves. Sometimes
one end would be upstream, and in a little
while the craft would spin around so that the door
had to be temporarily closed in order to keep the
driving rain from deluging them.</p>
<p>In the midst of this dreadful suspense they suddenly
felt that their onward motion had ceased. At
the same time they discovered the forward part of
the boat to be rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ashore!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe, looking ready
to plunge out of the door and take any sort of a
ducking rather than stay aboard, to risk death in
the flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Thad, clutching him just in
time to prevent any rashness; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to
leap before you look. There&rsquo;s water on this side
where the shore ought to be. I think the boat&rsquo;s
only shoved up on a sunken rock! If you jumped
now you&rsquo;d find yourself in the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she&rsquo;s swinging around right now, let
me tell you, Giraffe!&rdquo; added Davy Jones; &ldquo;look at
the other side coming up, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope she don&rsquo;t turn turtle, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
bellowed Bumpus; &ldquo;keep the door open, Thad, and
let me have a chance to get out if the worst comes,
because I need more time than the rest of you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was seen to edge closer to the stout scout,
as though he had made up his mind to give Bumpus,
who knew so little about swimming, all possible
assistance should the worst come to pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No danger this time,&rdquo; sang out Thad, &ldquo;for there
she slides off the rock, and our interrupted voyage
is on again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True enough, the shanty boat began to move,
rocked violently for a brief period, and then seemed
to be floating once more along the rolling current
on an even keel, greatly to the relief of Bumpus,
who was holding his breath with the dreadful suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you suppose now we can keep sailing
like this?&rdquo; Step Hen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If nothing happens to us until morning comes,&rdquo;
replied Thad, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find some way to get ashore,
when we can see how to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; added Davy. &ldquo;But I hope now we
don&rsquo;t strike any old cataract or falls, where we&rsquo;d
be swept over a dam, and get wrecked. Seems to
me I&rsquo;ve heard of such things along the Susquehanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words must have brought a new spasm of
alarm to the heart of Bumpus, for he clutched
Thad&rsquo;s sleeve, as though imploring him to set that
fear at rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are,&rdquo; the patrol leader told them, &ldquo;it
must be a good deal further upstream than where
we are. While the Susquehanna isn&rsquo;t called a
navigable river, except down near its mouth, where
it empties into the bay, it&rsquo;s an open stream for a
long distance. Don&rsquo;t bother thinking about mill-dams
and that sort of thing. The worst terror
we&rsquo;ve got to face is the everlasting snags all around
us. If one punched a hole in the lower part of the
boat we&rsquo;d be apt to sink.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we had life preservers, then,&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus; &ldquo;I thought every boat was compelled to
keep such things aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, if they carry a certain number of
passengers,&rdquo; Thad told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Giraffe, as he reached up and took
some small object from a shelf, where it had remained
all this while, in spite of the movements
of the boat, &ldquo;and this craft was well provided, too,
for you can see that this is an empty bottle, the mate
to the one the tramps threw away. They all seem
to patronize the same brand around this section,
too, because it&rsquo;s as like that other flask as two
peas in a pod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad looked at the emptied bottle, but made no
remark. Had Giraffe been observing the patrol
leader closely, however, instead of keeping his eyes
fixed on what he was exhibiting, he might have wondered
what the little flash of intelligence passing
over Thad&rsquo;s face could mean, and whether the
other had conceived a sudden thought of some kind.</p>
<p>They must have entered upon a section of the
river where the cross currents became stronger than
ever, for the drifting shanty boat&rsquo;s progress became
more erratic. Several times the boys found themselves
flung in a heap by an unheralded stoppage of
the boat, or an unusually wild movement sideways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is getting tougher and tougher the
further we go, and I must admit I don&rsquo;t fancy it
for a cent!&rdquo; grumbled Step Hen, after he had
picked himself up for the third time and rubbed
his knees as though they pained him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The worst I ever met up with, suh!&rdquo; declared
Bob White, steadying himself by clutching hold of
a hook that was fastened to the wall for some purpose
or other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of me,&rdquo; groaned Bumpus; &ldquo;when I come
down it&rsquo;s like a load of brick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; added Davy; &ldquo;&rsquo;specially
to the fellow underneath you, Bumpus. Why don&rsquo;t
you sit down all the time, and save yourself the
trouble of falling so much? You nearly crunched
me last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it don&rsquo;t hurt him to fall the same way
it does me,&rdquo; Giraffe wanted the rest to know, &ldquo;because
he&rsquo;s padded all over like a football player.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of diminishing, the erratic gyrations of
the whirling boat seemed to continually increase, if
such a thing were possible. Even Thad became
worried, for it was impossible to guess what would
happen next. Then again that impenetrable blackness
with which they were enveloped on all sides
must be anything but reassuring to even the bravest
heart. If they could only see out, and prepare for
each new and surprising shock, it might not be quite
so bad.</p>
<p>Minutes dragged along until they seemed almost
like hours to the scouts who, imprisoned in that
small cabin, found themselves at the mercy and
sport of the flood that was pouring down the Susquehanna.
Why, sometimes it seemed to Bumpus
he must be living in the time of old Noah, and that
this was the ark of refuge, with the forty days of
solid rain beating down upon it. Yes, and he could
almost fancy that he had some of the animals that
were taken in, two by two, around him, judging
from the queer attitudes which Davy Jones was
striking, for he was on all fours about half the
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Thad had figured out what they must do in case
of a wreck. This was to stand by the boat as long
as she remained afloat, and only strike out for the
shore in case of a complete collapse. He knew the
terrible risk all of them would run if they attempted
to swim that swollen stream, without daylight to
give them cheer, or show them their bearings; and
it was the last thing he wanted to try.</p>
<p>Perhaps nearly half an hour may have elapsed
since the boat had struck that sloping shelf of hidden
rock, when once again the same experience came
upon them.</p>
<p>This time they seemed to have been driven with
such speed that the boat slid far up on the rock,
and immediately careened toward the larboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going over this time, sure!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe;
and there was not one of his companions but
whose mind was filled with the same fear; for it
seemed as though nothing could prevent such a catastrophe
from happening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">HEARTS COURAGEOUS.</span></h2>
<p>It was a time of terrible suspense as the boat
tilted so far on one side that one or two of the boys
slipped, and fell, as though they were straddling
a bobsled, and on a steep down grade.</p>
<p>Higher still reared the one side of the cabin, until
it seemed as though the hearts of some of the
boys were in their throats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on the other side, everybody, quick!&rdquo; Thad
was shouting now, and the sound of his clarion
voice thrilled them as nothing else could have done.</p>
<p>It was not so easy to obey, such was the dreadful
slope to the floor of the cabin; but Giraffe gave
a helpful hand to struggling Bumpus, and on the
other side Allan fastened a good grip on the stout
one, so that between them both he was speedily
landed where he would do the most good.</p>
<p>Immediately the effect of this change of base began
to make itself felt, for instead of continuing
to rear up, that side of the boat settled slowly back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s slipping, and turning around!&rdquo; cried Giraffe;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to get off the old turtle-back
rock, don&rsquo;t you forget it! Whoop!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>As he gave that last yell the shanty boat did indeed
settle on an even keel, and once more there
was a buoyancy and motion to her. This told even
Bumpus, who was not supposed to know a great
deal about boats, that they were free from all entangling
alliances, and once more racing madly
down the river at the mercy of the flood.</p>
<p>Such was the hysterical excitement under which
all were laboring that regardless of what might still
be awaiting them in the near future the boys began
to yell, in order to relieve their pent-up feelings.</p>
<p>They soon stopped that sort of thing, however,
when their first exultation had passed, for, as Bumpus
remarked, &ldquo;it was just to begin over again, and
perhaps get upset after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep that till we&rsquo;re safe ashore,&rdquo; Giraffe
went on to remark. &ldquo;You know the old saying in
pioneer days used to be that an Indian never ought
to yell till he was in the woods; and a white man
till he was out of the woods. So we&rsquo;ll keep our
breath a while. It&rsquo;s all going to come out right, see
if it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe undoubtedly added these concluding reassuring
words for the particular benefit of Bumpus,
who was looking, as the tall scout privately informed
Step Hen back of his hand, &ldquo;just as limp
as a dish rag, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Giraffe; I surely hope so,&rdquo; the fat
scout told him. &ldquo;Why, I believe I could face being
burned up in a forest fire better than being
drowned. It&rsquo;s always been an awful idea to me to
float along on the water, and have the little fishes
and turtles nibbling at you all the while. Thank
you for saying we&rsquo;ve still got a fighting chance,
Giraffe. It was kind of you, and I won&rsquo;t forget it,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>When Giraffe looked up he saw Thad nodding his
head toward him, and he knew the explanation of
the encouraging smile on the patrol leader&rsquo;s face.
It meant that Thad understood why he had taken
the trouble to say what he did, and wished to encourage
all such efforts to the limit, as being worthy
of the best traditions of scoutcraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe, will you do me a favor?&rdquo; asked Davy,
after another period of alternate hope and fear had
passed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I will, Davy, if it&rsquo;s in my power;
only I hope you won&rsquo;t ask me to jump overboard,
and try to tow the old tub ashore, or anything like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just take a look at my head, please,&rdquo; suggested
the other, bending forward as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s swelled any since the
last time,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe; &ldquo;and, besides, strikes
me you haven&rsquo;t been doing any great stunts lately
that&rsquo;d be apt to make you have the big head. Whatever
do you want me to do, Davy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me if it&rsquo;s changed white,&rdquo; replied the other
pleadingly, &ldquo;because I reckon the scares we&rsquo;ve had
thrown into us this last half hour have sure been
enough to turn any poor fellow&rsquo;s hair. Will they
know me at home, if I&rsquo;m ever lucky enough to get
back there again; or can I expect to have the door
shut in my face, and our old dog Tige chase me
over the back fence?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you haven&rsquo;t changed much,&rdquo; Giraffe assured
him, &ldquo;except that there&rsquo;s an anxious look
stamped on your face like it&rsquo;d never come off again.
I&rsquo;m surprised at you, Davy; why don&rsquo;t you grin
and bear it like I do? This is only going to be
another of our <i>experiences</i>, and before long you&rsquo;ll
look back at it, and laugh at the whole business.
Whee! there she rises again, fellows. Everybody
<i>climb</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were becoming quite expert now with regard
to executing what Giraffe called a &ldquo;flank
movement;&rdquo; for even Bumpus was able to scramble
up the sloping floor before anyone could take hold
of his arms.</p>
<p>Again they felt more or less concerned while the
boat hung in a state of uncertainty, as though undecided
whether to keep on turning until the upset
came, or slide off again into deep water.</p>
<p>When the latter came to pass all of them breathed
easy again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; said Smithy, taking a full breath,
&ldquo;this sort of thing has got to continue for hours,
before morning comes. Why, we&rsquo;ll be out of our
minds, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky to have any minds at all, to go
out of,&rdquo; Giraffe told him. &ldquo;Some fellows would
be that way to start with&mdash;present company always
excepted, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was one of those kind of boys who would
have his little fling at a joke, no matter what sort
of a scrape he might be in. Such a buoyant nature
helped to keep the spirits of his comrades up, and
so far it was useful, at least.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it, anyway?&rdquo; demanded Step Hen.
&ldquo;Seems to me we&rsquo;ve been banging around like this
for a whole week or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; announced Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have daylight at seven, even on
such a bad morning,&rdquo; remarked Thad, &ldquo;which
would mean about two more hours of it before we
can make any sort of a move to get ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two whole hours!&rdquo; sighed Bumpus, looking as
though he feared he would be mashed into a mere
pulp by that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try and forget our troubles,&rdquo; remarked
Giraffe; &ldquo;suppose, now, Bumpus here could start
one of his jolly songs, and we&rsquo;d all come in heavy
on the chorus. That&rsquo;d be something worth while
remembering in future days, when we wanted folks
to know how scouts could face trouble bravely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; cried Bumpus, starting up, &ldquo;that makes
me think of stories I&rsquo;ve read how the British crew
on the battleship <i>Campertown</i> lined up as she was
sinking, and with the band playing went down in
the ocean. Do you really think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going
to happen to us here, Giraffe; and is it a funeral
dirge you want me to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, but the liveliest song you know,
old fellow; so get busy, and it&rsquo;ll make us feel better
all around,&rdquo; the tall scout assured him.</p>
<p>Bumpus swallowed hard several times, as though
not at all sure about his voice, and then he started
in. At first there was a decided tremolo noticeable,
but as he went on he gained assurance, and presently
was doing nobly. When the proper time came
for the chorus every one of them joined in, so that
the volume of sound must have arisen well above
the noise of the rushing waters and the wild blasts
of the wind through the leafless trees ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Had anyone by chance been within hearing distance
and caught the clamor of boyish voices that
swelled forth from the cabin of that shanty boat,
drifting down on the bosom of the mighty flood,
they might well have been pardoned if they found
themselves wondering whether some asylum had
yielded up its inmates, the whole thing appeared so
remarkable.</p>
<p>Giraffe was right, and Thad, knowing it, had not
attempted to raise a hand to prevent the carrying
out of the singular compact. That song cheered
them up wonderfully indeed; by the time it was
ended even Bumpus felt quite sanguine that they
were bound to pass through the fresh trial unscathed.
He was ready to carry on the good work
as long as his voice held out.</p>
<p>So he started a second school song that was
familiar to them, and being in better practice now,
they all did more justice to the theme.</p>
<p>It was interrupted by the surging boat striking
a rock, so that the sudden jar tumbled them in a
heap; but upon scrambling to their feet once more
the singing was taken up again as though nothing
had happened.</p>
<p>Thad was wondering whether any damage could
have been done when that last hard knock came
against the timbers of the boat. He did not know
what they could stand in the way of resistance.
They might be old, and weather-beaten, ready to
yield if harshly treated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>And so, as his comrades sang on at a vociferous
rate, Thad was trying to discover whether there
were any signs of the boat foundering, which was
apt to happen in case of a puncture below the water
line.</p>
<p>Of course he could not make absolutely sure, but
so far as he was able to tell there did not seem to
be anything wrong; the boat floated as buoyantly
as before the collision.</p>
<p>When all of the boys found themselves getting
more or less hoarse from their strained singing
they stopped; but Bumpus by this time felt so
heartened that his next move was to clutch his beloved
bugle, and proceed to run the gamut of
everything he knew, from military calls to &ldquo;&rsquo;Way
Down on the Suwanee River,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old Black Joe,&rdquo;
and a dozen other melodies that he could execute
with considerable feeling and sweetness on the silver-tongued
instrument.</p>
<p>In this fashion possibly another half hour passed.
When Smithy asked for the time, and they heard
Allan say there was still a terribly long spell ahead
of them, the scouts were at a loss to know just what
to do in order to forget their troubles, and make the
minutes seem to pass quickly.</p>
<p>They were spared the necessity of inventing some
way, for just then there came one of those sudden
halts in the forward progress of the drifting shanty
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another snag!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe, as though the
frequency of these mishaps was beginning to take
their terror away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But notice that this time we don&rsquo;t seem to tilt
over to one side; and it feels firmer, too!&rdquo; Step
Hen wanted them to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then chances are we&rsquo;re stuck here for a while,
till the river rises, and sets us free!&rdquo; commented
Davy.</p>
<p>Allan and Thad exchanged significant looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s anything in that, Thad, or
can it be land?&rdquo; asked the former, as he saw his
chum start for the door, which was partly open at
the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain seems to have let up some, anyway!&rdquo;
proclaimed Smithy, as though he did not want them
to think he was behind the rest in noticing things
worth while.</p>
<p>When the two scouts reached the door and thrust
their heads out, they saw the same old gloom there,
&ldquo;thick enough to cut with a knife,&rdquo; as Giraffe would
have said. But Thad discovered something more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up against the sky, Allan!&rdquo; he cried joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trees, as sure as you live!&rdquo; shouted the other,
almost immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; roared Giraffe, pushing
alongside; &ldquo;trees, is it, and us out in the middle of
the flooded Susquehanna? How&rsquo;s that come, Thad?
Is this an old island we&rsquo;ve bumped against?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I calculate that&rsquo;s just what it is, Giraffe,&rdquo; was
the reply of the patrol leader; and at hearing this
astonishing as well as pleasing news the rest of the
inmates of the cabin broke out into a shout that
under ordinary conditions might have been heard
a full mile away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah, and a tiger!&rdquo; was
what Giraffe called for and the cheers were given
with a vim that took their breath away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE ISLAND OF HOPE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the solid ground every time,&rdquo; Bumpus
burst out with; and from the broad grin on his
face, no longer pallid, it was easy to see that he
meant what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need it!&rdquo; Step Hen told him dryly, which
of course was a little thrust at the heft of the stout
scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we expect to go ashore, Thad, may I
ask?&rdquo; Smithy wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain is stopping, as sure as anything, and
that&rsquo;s one comfort,&rdquo; declared Davy, knowing the
aversion felt by the particular member of the patrol,
who belonged to the great Smith family, to getting
his nice suit wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best we can do,&rdquo; came the reply from the
chief of the expedition, &ldquo;is to get our duffel ready,
and if there&rsquo;s any sign of the boat moving off, why
we could disembark in a big hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granny governor! do you really think she <i>may</i>
take a sudden notion to start out again on another
cruise?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, looking anxious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say,&rdquo; he was told, &ldquo;because it
depends a whole lot on what the wind does. It&rsquo;s
blowing great guns right now, but so long as it
holds down-river way I think the shanty boat will
stick here on this point. But there&rsquo;s a chance of it
changing more into the northwest, and then nothing
could hold the boat here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t we tie her up somehow to one of
those trees, you know?&rdquo; demanded Smithy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we had the cable to do it with,&rdquo; Thad
informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;there was a rope, seems to me?&rdquo; continued
Smithy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look at it, Allan, and let&rsquo;s hear what you
think,&rdquo; said the leader.</p>
<p>At that Allan darted outside, despising the scanty
rain that was still coming down, though decreasing
constantly. Hardly had half a minute elapsed before
the scout was back inside again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; asked Giraffe impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a piece of cable there, all right,&rdquo; came
the reply; &ldquo;I dragged it out of the water where it&rsquo;s
been ever since we broke away up above. Seems to
be a pretty hefty rope, too, even if it did give way
under that terrific strain; but for all that, boys, it
won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean there isn&rsquo;t enough of it, don&rsquo;t you,
Allan?&rdquo; asked Thad, who apparently had foreseen
just such an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lacks many feet of being worth while,&rdquo; replied
the other; &ldquo;so you see, Smithy, a rope&rsquo;s something
we haven&rsquo;t got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse,&rsquo; only
in this case it&rsquo;s a bully old half-inch cable we want
most of all,&rdquo; Giraffe asserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think we&rsquo;d better take Thad&rsquo;s advice,
and get our stuff together, so if it comes to a case
of jump we&rsquo;ll be ready to skip out of this,&rdquo; Bumpus
remarked; for he evidently dreaded another siege
similar to the last, with the shanty boat whirling
down the agitated river, subject to innumerable
risks, such as kept one&rsquo;s heart jumping up toward
his throat in a most uncomfortable way, to say the
least.</p>
<p>It did not take them long to do this, for besides
their haversacks, blankets, guns, and the few cooking
utensils they had with them, their possessions
did not amount to much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the stuff aboard the old boat&mdash;had
we ought to commandeer that?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, who
did dislike to see anything in the shape of food get
away from him, when it might just as well be saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think we had a right to grab what food
there is. It don&rsquo;t amount to a great deal, and
we&rsquo;d be only too glad to pay for the same if ever
we ran across the owner of the tub,&rdquo; ventured
Bumpus, also having an eye to the future, and a
strong dislike for the first gnawing of hunger.</p>
<p>They all looked to Thad to decide that point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the chances are the boat will either be
wrecked on some of these ugly jagged rocks that
lie in wait all along the course, or else fall into the
hands of boys who may be watching the flood for
driftwood and such stuff, it seems all right to me
to take what we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right of first discoverers!&rdquo; remarked
Smithy grandly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a piece of breakfast bacon, suh, hanging
up behind the stove,&rdquo; quickly announced Bob White,
who apparently clung to the ways of his beloved
South, where the ordinary salt pork is always called
&ldquo;bacon,&rdquo; and the smoked sides go under the name
he mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a package of grits as you call the fine
hominy corn, in that box under the table, Bob,
which ought to make you as happy as a king. What
more could a fellow from Dixieland want more
than hog and hominy?&rdquo; Allan laughingly announced.</p>
<p>They gathered the things wanted near the door,
and every scout knew exactly what his identical
share of the burden was going to be. This was
done so that if there should be any need for a hurried
desertion of the boat there might not ensue
any disastrous confusion that would cost them
dearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon now the old cheese-box-on-a-raft would
turn out too heavy for us to drag any further up
on the shore, so even the wind couldn&rsquo;t take her
off?&rdquo; Step Hen chanced to remark, after they had
finished their preparations for departure, and huddled
near the door, taking frequent observations
concerning the state of the weather outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; Thad returned, &ldquo;though we
might give it a try when we do drop ashore, and see
what we can do. These scows weigh tons, you
know, and get logy in the bargain from being so
long in the water. We&rsquo;d need a block and tackle to
manage it decently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a pity we didn&rsquo;t think to bring one
along, then,&rdquo; commented innocent Smithy, at which
remark the rest set up a yell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see you staggering along with the whole
outfit on your back, Smithy,&rdquo; he was told by Giraffe;
&ldquo;why, the blocks alone would faze you, not
to mention the rope itself. If you&rsquo;ve got a boat
to carry it in, then it&rsquo;s all right to have the same
along. But we started off light on this trip, you
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun we did,&rdquo; grunted Bumpus; &ldquo;that pack
of mine weighs an awful lot; and then the old coffee
pot keeps cracking my shins every time I trip.
But of course,&rdquo; he hastened to add, as though he
hoped they would not believe he was complaining,
&ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t think of going without our refreshing
Java for breakfasts. Life&rsquo;d be pretty dreary to
Giraffe, and a few of the rest of us, if we didn&rsquo;t
have their favorite beverage mornings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look out there, fellows, and tell me if you
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really getting some lighter,&rdquo; Step
Hen besought them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can see the trees a heap better than
before,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe; &ldquo;but that might come
from our eyes getting more accustomed to looking
into the darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s full time for day to break,&rdquo; they were
assured by Allan, who had immediately turned toward
the friendly little lamp so as to examine his
watch.</p>
<p>A general sigh as of relief followed this welcome
announcement. That had been a terribly long
night, and one those scouts were not apt to forget
in a hurry. They may have been through considerable
in the way of adventure in the past, but somehow
that experience of being carried headlong
downstream on the wild flood, with frequent alarms
as the boat struck treacherous shoals and half-hidden
rocks, made a deep impression on their minds,
from the leader down to Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s going to clear up?&rdquo; asked
Smithy, who did not pretend to be a weather sharp,
and always depended on some of his mates when in
need of information along these lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s raining a single drop now,&rdquo;
Davy informed them, after stepping outside on the
deck, and holding up his face to learn the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s just as gray overhead as ever,&rdquo; added
Giraffe, who could be a pessimist when he chose,
and always see the dark side of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we have a bite to eat while we&rsquo;re waiting
for morning to come,&rdquo; suggested Allan; and from
the way both Giraffe and Bumpus started eagerly
up, as though they heartily approved of the idea, it
was plain that both of them had been thinking along
these same lines though not wishing to betray their
inclinations, for fear of having the finger of scorn
pointed at them.</p>
<p>The suggestion seemed to meet with popular
favor; at least it aroused no objections, for all of
them realized that with such a deluge, dry wood
was going to be a scarce commodity ashore for part
of the ensuing day at least; and it was only policy
for them to take advantage of the chance they had
of obtaining a splendid cooking fire aboard the boat.</p>
<p>The operation of preparing breakfast did not
take them a great while, for long experience made
them experts along these lines. And while they
were doing this the darkness without gradually
gave way to the gray dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>While the immediate prospect ahead of them was
far from cheerful, it seemed such a vast improvement
over what they had recently faced that every
one of the eight boys felt ready to joke and laugh
as they partook of the meal.</p>
<p>Step Hen was up to his old tricks again, and accusing
his chums of hiding some of his possessions
that afterward turned up in the very place he had
put them. It was generally that way, for Step Hen
<i>forgot</i>, which was his most cardinal sin. And even
when he found that he had his bandanna tied around
his neck, though tucked out of sight, after asking
Giraffe if he had purloined the same, he indignantly
wanted to know who had played that mean trick on
him, so as to make him believe he had lost his most
cherished possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step Hen,&rdquo; said Giraffe gravely, &ldquo;you make me
think of one of those pearl divers that go down in
the Indian Ocean for oysters. When a big shark
waits for him to rise from the bottom what does
the native do but stir up the sand, and make the
water so roily that the man-eater just can&rsquo;t see him
when he shoots to the surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! so I&rsquo;m a shark, am I?&rdquo; demanded Step Hen
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re the smart pearl diver,&rdquo; retorted Giraffe;
&ldquo;for when you find yourself caught in a hole,
and that all the while you&rsquo;re wearing the lost hat
or the bandanna, you accuse us of having put it
there, so as to blind everybody&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Allan, with a laugh, &ldquo;Step Hen is
like the thief being chased by a mob; and who yells
out at the top of his voice, &lsquo;Stop, thief!&rsquo; so everybody
he meets will think he&rsquo;s the man who&rsquo;s been
robbed; and in the confusion he gets off. You&rsquo;re
the guilty one who poked that red rag under the
collar of your flannel shirt, and the less you say
about it the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Step Hen, finding himself routed,
only grinned, and wisely held his peace, realizing
that the boys were &ldquo;on to him,&rdquo; as Giraffe put it.</p>
<p>So breakfast was eaten, and at least they all felt
in better trim to face what new troubles the day
might bring in its train.</p>
<p>Bumpus would never be happy so long as they
remained aboard that clumsy craft. He haunted
the deck, and kept watching the rushing river, as
well as the way the furious wind blew.</p>
<p>Whenever a gust bore down upon them that
caused the boat to move he would hurry inside,
and give Thad a look of mute appeal that was very
forceful. It meant that Bumpus wanted the leader
to give the word to disembark. Though the island
presented but a dismal prospect for the castaways,
anything was better than running the risk of being
blown adrift again. And Bumpus did want to feel
solid ground under his feet again more than words
could say.</p>
<p>Thad, however, did not mean to desert their comfortable
quarters so easily, and had made up his
mind to wait until the danger became more real and
apparent. This must all depend upon the force
and direction of the wind, which, however, all of
them could see was steadily veering toward the
northwest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">STILL SURROUNDED BY PERILS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky to be here and not out there on
that water,&rdquo; Thad said, in the ear of the stout
scout, as he came upon him standing in the lee of
the cabin, and looking across the river, which
seemed very wide at this point, though probably
extremely shallow despite the flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say we were,&rdquo; admitted Bumpus, shaking
his head. &ldquo;Looks ugly, doesn&rsquo;t it, with the wind
flaws rushing over the water every little way, and
making a dark streak with each squall? But don&rsquo;t
you think she&rsquo;s still rising, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it,&rdquo; he was told. &ldquo;When I came
out here a while ago it stood six inches below that
black mark on the rock you can see there, and look
what it is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more&rsquo;n three,&rdquo; muttered Bumpus apprehensively;
&ldquo;but, Thad, you don&rsquo;t really think she&rsquo;s
going to keep on rising, and that some time the
whole island&rsquo;ll be covered, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing what had been worrying Bumpus, Thad
did not do as was Giraffe&rsquo;s usual habit, add to his
fears by portentous suggestions. On the contrary
he sought to dissipate all such uneasy thoughts by
plain common sense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That could hardly happen, Bumpus,&rdquo; he told the
other plainly; &ldquo;if you use your eyes you&rsquo;ll see the
land keeps on rising as it leaves the water, so that
it stands to reason there&rsquo;s quite an elevation about
the middle of the island. And as the rain has
stopped, with signs of the clouds breaking over in
the northwest, I figure that while the river may
continue to rise all day, the increase will get less
and less, so that by another morning it ought to be
back in its regular banks again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure glad to hear you say that, Thad,
because, you know, I&rsquo;m not near as spry as Davy
about climbing trees. He&rsquo;s a born monkey, if ever
there was one, and likes nothing better than to hang
by his toes from a limb fifty feet up. Now, I&rsquo;d
look nice doing that, wouldn&rsquo;t I? So what you tell
me eases my mind a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be feeling thankful we passed
through all we did without any serious accident,&rdquo;
Thad told him. &ldquo;This flood may have caught a lot
of people not prepared, along the low lands of the
river, and I expect to see pig-pens and chicken
coops sailing past here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! and if we could only lasso some of those
coops, why, we might find a few feathered songbirds
inside the same, which would be a great addition
to our menu while we&rsquo;re marooned on this
island,&rdquo; Bumpus suggested gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as we haven&rsquo;t any rope to use as a lariat,&rdquo;
Thad told him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that lovely scheme won&rsquo;t
pan out very well. Still, I&rsquo;m glad to see that you&rsquo;re
awake to the necessity of invention. Thinking up
things is going to do anyone lots of good, even if
there&rsquo;s no practical result.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the wind, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still shifting, and going to do the business for
this old boat, sooner or later, if it keeps blowing
as hard as it is now,&rdquo; the patrol leader replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking I&rsquo;d like to be the first to set foot
on the island; not that I&rsquo;m afraid, I hope you&rsquo;ll believe,
Thad; but just from a sort of sentimental
reason, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, chances are we&rsquo;ll all be doing it pretty
soon, Bumpus; so if you really want to, go ahead,&rdquo;
Thad told him, keeping a straight face while speaking,
but at the same time much amused, for he
knew that despite the solemn protest of his companion
Bumpus was very uneasy.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later and Giraffe called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what d&rsquo;ye think, fellows, we&rsquo;ve been left
in the lurch. Bumpus has deserted us, and is
camped ashore right now, spread his blanket out on
a log, and is sitting there like the king of the cannibal
island. He must have felt the boat getting
wobbly, and thought he&rsquo;d make sure not to be in
the last rush when she broke away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him to go ashore,&rdquo; Thad informed them;
&ldquo;and I guess the rest of us would be wise to follow
his example. So get your stuff and come on,
the whole lot of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just hate to leave all that nice dry kindling
wood behind me,&rdquo; complained Giraffe, whose specialty
was fires of any and all kinds, and who never
failed to keep an eye out for a chance to have one
started.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, there&rsquo;s nothing to hinder you
from coming back after it,&rdquo; Thad told him. &ldquo;Get
Step Hen or Davy to lend a hand. If we have to
stay on the island for twenty-four hours, more or
less, we might as well have all the comforts going,
and at that they won&rsquo;t swamp us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that same as sure as you live,&rdquo; asserted
the lengthy scout, pleased with the suggestion.</p>
<p>So after they deposited their belongings, together
with what they had appropriated from the owner&rsquo;s
scanty stock of food, Giraffe spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davy, Thad says you might go back with me
and help land something we can make good use of,
if the boat should be drifted away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t want the old cracked stove, I
hope?&rdquo; ejaculated Davy, guessing that it must
have something to do with cooking, or Giraffe
would not be displaying so much eagerness about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! me carry a stove on shore when I know
a dozen ways to cook on a regular camp fire?&rdquo; cried
the tall scout derisively; &ldquo;well, I should say nothing
doing along that line. But we&rsquo;ll have trouble getting
dry wood to start things with, and so Thad
says we might as well throw all that lot on shore
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy was a reasonable fellow, and he saw the
good sense of such a move at once; so he readily
agreed to go aboard the abandoned shanty boat
with Giraffe, and take possession of the fuel supply.</p>
<p>As the wind carried more or less spray across
the exposed place where the boys had landed, it
was later on agreed that they would do well to go
further ashore. The trees were bare, and there
would be no drip, as might have been the case in
summertime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Makes me think of a gypsy caravan on the
tramp!&rdquo; Step Hen announced, after all of them were
on the move, laden down with their various burdens,
Giraffe even carrying a small package of
extra-fine kindling, with which he meant to start his
first fire, and Davy &ldquo;toting&rdquo; the old ax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wind is something fierce when it comes
with a rush and a roar,&rdquo; Smithy was saying, as he
watched some of the trees swaying under the blast;
&ldquo;I hope now this isn&rsquo;t going to be a case of dodging
one peril to hit another. You know there used
to be a rock and a whirlpool that the old Grecian
mariners dreaded, for if they missed being piled
up on Scylla, they had to run the risk of being
sucked into Charybdis. We call it &lsquo;jumping out of
the frying pan into the fire.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, whatever are you thinking about,
Smithy?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus, who had been feeling
so well satisfied lately that he disliked to hear any
dark hints about new perils hovering over their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep close by, Smithy, and be ready to
grab you if the wind tries to carry you away any
old time,&rdquo; Giraffe assured the other scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it isn&rsquo;t that, Giraffe; I was only wondering
if one of those tall trees took a notion to topple
over while we were walking underneath it, why,
with all these bundles on our backs, we couldn&rsquo;t
very well get out of the way in time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! that&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; Bumpus admitted, as he began
to turn his head from one side to the other in
the endeavor to cover the ground, without thinking
that the peril could only come from windward, if
it existed at all.</p>
<p>Now, while Thad hardly believed they had anything
to fear from this source, he did not think it
wise to take unnecessary chances; and even before
Smithy voiced his sentiments the patrol leader was
so shaping his course as to avoid every tree that
had a suspicious look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one thing that keeps bothering me, outside
of our limited stock of provisions, which is always
a serious matter,&rdquo; Giraffe broke in at that moment,
&ldquo;is the fact that all our fine tracking work counts
for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon, suh, you mean that we&rsquo;re bound to
lose the object of our chase?&rdquo; remarked Bob White.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, the hobo with the old blue army coat
is going to get such a start on us, before we escape
from this river trap, that we never will be able to
run him down. I&rsquo;m sorry as anything, too, because
I was hoping another big scoop was headed
our way. Now, we&rsquo;ll have to go home like so many
dogs, with their tails between their legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, Giraffe,&rdquo; declared Allan,
&ldquo;because none of the rest of us feel a bit that way.
We&rsquo;ve done the best we could, and no one is responsible
when they run counter to a storm like
the one we&rsquo;ve struck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Thad, who did not like the way
the tall scout talked, &ldquo;nobody but the judge really
knows a thing about our chase of that hobo who got
the old army coat from Mrs. Whittaker; and if we
fail to recover the same he isn&rsquo;t the one to give it
away. So we can say we had a great hike, got
caught in a flood, and let it go at that. But all the
same I don&rsquo;t give up hopes of finding this Wandering
George yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say, suh,&rdquo; Bob
White admitted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like a sticker
in my estimation; and I can well remember plenty
of times when holding out to the bitter end brought
victory along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;ve all got a touch of that in our makeup,
Bob,&rdquo; Giraffe told him; &ldquo;even Bumpus here can
be as obstinate as a mule when he chooses. Just
yesterday I was trying to coax him to give me that
fine new waterproof match safe he carries, and d&rsquo;ye
know he actually refused me three separate times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; commented Bumpus, hearing this,
&ldquo;you make me think of the Irishman on the jury
who, when they were discharged for failing to
agree, upon being asked how it happened, said there
were <i>eleven</i> of the most pig-headed obstinate men
on that jury he ever saw, and that try as hard as he
could they refused to come around to his way of
thinking. If the shoe fits, Giraffe, put it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe laughed just as loud as any of them, for
he could at least enjoy a joke that was aimed at
himself, which was one of his best qualities.</p>
<p>The ground did seem to rise more or less the
further they got away from the northern end of the
island, just as Thad had told Bumpus when the latter
member of the marooned patrol was expressing
his fears of being overwhelmed in the advancing
flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Now and then they had glimpses of the river, and
somehow they felt an irresistible temptation to gaze
out over the wind-swept water whenever the opportunity
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at that squall coming across, would
you?&rdquo; ejaculated Bumpus; &ldquo;why, it is scooping the
water up, and throwing it around like mist. Ain&rsquo;t
I glad we&rsquo;re on solid ground right now? And wait
till it strikes the shore. Let me tell you it&rsquo;s a good
thing this island&rsquo;s firmly anchored, or it&rsquo;d be blown
away. Hold tight to your hats, fellows, I warn
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden swoop, and a mighty roar,
as the squall broke among the trees around them.
When there came a startling crash the scouts huddled
together and stared in the direction of the
sound, being just in time to see one of the tallest
trees come toppling over, with a roar that seemed
to shake the ground beneath their very feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">THE RETURN OF GIRAFFE.</span></h2>
<p>Standing there, gripping their hats as the fierce
wind continued to sweep past, the scouts exchanged
serious looks. The fall of that tree had given them
a feeling of thankfulness that they were not under
it at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how that would have squashed us!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bumpus, when he could catch his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; ventured Smithy, &ldquo;I had my eye
on that big chap, and was wondering whether he&rsquo;d
hold up against the next squall. So you see I wasn&rsquo;t
so silly, after all, when I mentioned such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody said you were, Smithy,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe;
&ldquo;but, Thad, how&rsquo;d it do to stop near where
that tree crashed down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you pick out that place in particular?&rdquo;
queried Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! first of all they say lightning never strikes
twice in the same place, and so there&rsquo;d be no danger
of another tree dropping on us. Then, again, don&rsquo;t
you understand what a lot of chopping it&rsquo;ll save us,
having all that good wood ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right about that, Giraffe,&rdquo; returned
Step Hen; &ldquo;for it made an awful crash when it hit
the ground, and must have busted in many parts.
It certainly takes you to think up all kinds of kinks
connected with fires and fuel supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody&rsquo;s got to do the thinking for the
crowd, you know,&rdquo; returned the other, assuming an
air of importance; &ldquo;and when others shirk their
duty it comes harder for us faithful members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patrol leader thought so much of Giraffe&rsquo;s
sensible suggestion that he gave the word for a
halt; and so they selected a place that looked as
though it would make a pretty decent camp.</p>
<p>Here their burdens were only too willingly
dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get a fair amount of shelter from the wind,
you see,&rdquo; remarked Thad, as he looked around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Thad, it took that tree over like a shot,&rdquo;
remonstrated Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because it had a clear sweep at its top,&rdquo;
he was told, &ldquo;for these other trees are not nearly
so tall as the one that went down. Then if you
examine the stump you can see that it was rotten
at the heart, though it didn&rsquo;t show outside to any
extent. That&rsquo;s the way with lots of men who, as
they say, can smile and smile again, and yet be
villains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we go to write up this trip for our log
book,&rdquo; Davy observed at this juncture, &ldquo;I think it
ought to go down as a sort of Robinson Crusoe
story. Because right now we&rsquo;re wrecked on a
desert island, with a limited amount of stuff along,
and may be compelled to resort to all sorts of things
for a living.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s any game over here to help
out, if we have to stay a long time?&rdquo; ventured Giraffe,
the hunter instinct strong within him.
&ldquo;Course we couldn&rsquo;t expect to find wild goats, like
Robinson did, but then there might be rabbits, and
even squirrels and raccoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! I&rsquo;d just like to see myself eating a part of
a raccoon!&rdquo; exclaimed the particular scout, lifting
both hands to further indicate his disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may have that pleasure, if we stay
here long enough, Smithy,&rdquo; he was assured by Giraffe;
&ldquo;now, as for me, I&rsquo;d as soon partake of a
&rsquo;coon as I would a young pig. &rsquo;Possum I know is
fine, and I reckon the other would go all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I happen to have several fishhooks in my
haversack that I forgot to remove after our last
trip, when we went South with Thad; so you see
we might pull in some fish if we got real hard
pressed,&rdquo; and Bumpus smiled contentedly as he
made this statement, for which he was applauded
by Giraffe and Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking about Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo; said Thad,
&ldquo;our case runs along a good deal like his for other
reasons than that we&rsquo;re stranded on an island. You
know he hewed out a boat so big that he couldn&rsquo;t
get it down to the water; and we&rsquo;ve got one on our
hands so heavy that all of us couldn&rsquo;t budge her
an inch when we tried to drag the same further up
on the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if the case is going to keep on in parallel
lines,&rdquo; mused Bumpus; &ldquo;for you know how old
Robinson found the footprints of savages on
the sand one morning. What if we do here on our
island?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! shucks! what would we care, so long as
we&rsquo;re heavily armed, and eight of us all told, when
poor old Crusoe was alone? I&rsquo;d give something
just to run across a footprint that wasn&rsquo;t made by
one of us, and that&rsquo;s straight, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one doubted but what Giraffe meant every
word, for his boldness had never been reckoned
a questionable article. Indeed, on some occasions
he had even shown bravery bordering on recklessness,
so that the scout leader found it necessary to
take him to task.</p>
<p>Giraffe soon amused himself in taking stock of
their available supply of food, and listing the same
in his methodical way. He would soon know just
how many meals they could count on before being
compelled to hustle for further supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, since we&rsquo;ve never struck this island before,
and ain&rsquo;t supposed to know a single thing
about what sort of animals inhabit it, if any, I&rsquo;m
expecting to hang the eatables out of harm&rsquo;s way.
That&rsquo;s why I fetched this leavings of the old cable
along with me. I&rsquo;ll take time to unravel the kinks,
and untwist the windings, so in the end I&rsquo;ll have
quite a fine stout cord that&rsquo;s going to be mighty
useful in a whole lot of ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was happy only when busily employed.
At other times he was apt to seem restless, and
much like a tiger pacing up and down in its cage.</p>
<p>They were making themselves as comfortable as
possible under the strange conditions that prevailed.
All scouts are drilled in the art of observation, and
constantly keeping their eyes on the alert in order
to better their situation. So it was first one fellow
who would decide to do a thing this way; and
then another would go him one better, always with
a spirit of healthy rivalry that was productive of
results.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the sun!&rdquo; announced Smithy suddenly,
for he had seen it glint on the agitated water far out
on the eastern side, where there was an opening in
the brush through which it was possible to glimpse
the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, stranger!&rdquo; called out Giraffe, dramatically
saluting; &ldquo;we hope your stay with us may
be long and happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels real good, too, after so much gloomy
weather, and all that downpour,&rdquo; Bumpus declared,
as he opened his coat to let the warm rays strike
him more fully.</p>
<p>Giraffe of course had his fire going; life would
be shorn of much of its bright features if he were
prevented from pursuing his favorite hobby. The
old ax served to supply them with heavier fuel,
which seemed to burn splendidly after being in
part dried out.</p>
<p>Seeing Thad beckoning, the tall scout stepped
over beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to do an errand for me, Giraffe?&rdquo;
asked the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time, if only you don&rsquo;t ask me to walk on
the water to the shore, which is a little more than I
can manage,&rdquo; replied the other promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about an idea that struck me all of a
sudden, as I was sitting on this log here,&rdquo; announced
Thad. &ldquo;I hardly know what put it in my
mind to think of that shanty boat again. Perhaps
it was our joshing about what Robinson Crusoe
would be likely to do, if he found himself located
like we are. But no matter, I suddenly remembered
I had meant to examine that boat better, and then it
happened that something put it out of my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examine the shanty boat better, do you mean,
Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I remembered noticing what looked like a
square consisting of plain cracks, on the floor of the
cabin. The more I get to thinking of it, Giraffe,
the stronger it strikes me that there may be some
sort of trap door there. The boat must be hollow,
that stands to reason, and if the water could be
kept from getting in, such a place would be a good
hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! do you mean for extra grub supplies,
or something else, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of something else,&rdquo; came the reply.
&ldquo;You remember how we found supper cooking
on the stove when we broke into that boat cabin,
yet never a solitary soul around? Well, supposing
the man who was doing the cooking heard us when
we let out those wild yells, and seeing soldiers coming
down on him like wild cats, he just dodged below,
<i>and stayed there</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean all night long, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, right up to the time we left the boat this
morning,&rdquo; the patrol leader went on to say solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But could he stand it all that time?&rdquo; asked Giraffe
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not have been the most comfortable
thing going,&rdquo; admitted Thad; &ldquo;but a fellow can
stand for a whole lot when he just has to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he&rsquo;d do it, rather than risk coming
out, and being gobbled up by the militia, is that it,
Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve caught my idea, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Thad, just think how he must have suffered
all the while we rocked in the cradle of the
deep like we did?&rdquo; ventured the other, shaking his
head as though he could hardly bring himself to believe
it possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take a good deal of grit to hold out,
for a fact, but then he might be so much afraid of
arrest that of two evils he chose the lesser,&rdquo; Thad
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you want me to do?&rdquo; queried the
tall scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just go to where we left the boat, and see if
those cracks mean some sort of trap leading to the
hold of the float. Be careful how you open it, because
if the owner is hiding in there he may try to
do something desperate. Perhaps you&rsquo;d better take
Step Hen along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess not, unless you insist, Thad. I&rsquo;ll carry
a gun, and with that I&rsquo;ll be equal to any refugee that
ever walked on two legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe liked nothing better than to be dispatched
on a mission of this kind. He said nothing to any
of the others, only picked up his gun, sang out to
Bumpus not to let the fire die down for lack of
fresh wood, and then walked away.</p>
<p>Some of the rest looked after him curiously, and
wondered what he was up to; but as Step Hen had
seen him in consultation with Thad he told them
it was none of their business, but that the tall scout
had undoubtedly been sent off on an errand by the
commander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Bumpus, feeling a certain sense of responsibility
on account of having been especially designated as
the guardian of the fire, took it upon himself to
make certain that there was a plentiful supply of
wood handy. It was a comical sight to see him
swing the old ax, and hear him give a loud grunt
every time he sent it home. But nevertheless he
managed to keep things going, for he was very persistent,
and hated to let any object escape him, once
he had set his mind on accomplishing the same.</p>
<p>It was perhaps fifteen minutes later that they
heard a shout, and looking up discovered some one
running toward them, waving his arms wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes Giraffe, like hot cakes,&rdquo; announced
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he looks wild in the bargain,&rdquo; added Step
Hen. &ldquo;I wonder now has he run on any savages
getting ready for a feast like the ones Robinson
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re only fooling, I know, because savages
couldn&rsquo;t be here along the Susquehanna!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bumpus; but nevertheless he began to show
signs of fresh anxiety; and waited for the runner
to come up, with a thousand questions in his manner.</p>
<p>So Giraffe came along, slackening his pace as he
drew near, for he was breathing hard, and casting
occasional glances back of him, which latter action
in itself was sufficient cause for Bumpus to believe
he must have been chased by some one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Giraffe?&rdquo; he called out, even before
the other had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell us what ails you, and why you&rsquo;ve been
running so fast?&rdquo; Step Hen went on to say, as they
all crowded around the panting runner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">WHAT DAVY HEARD.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You guessed right, Thad!&rdquo; said Giraffe, looking
toward the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; demanded Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that it&rsquo;d be dangerous for us to try and
stick to the old bug of a shanty boat, with all that
wind blowing,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she gone, Giraffe?&rdquo; demanded Thad
quickly, and the other nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cleaned out, as sure as anything, and not a sign
of her around, as far as I could see,&rdquo; he went on to
explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must have been the great big blast that
set her adrift,&rdquo; Davy added, doing his best to explain
the mystery. &ldquo;It was enough to whip her
off the shore, with the water rising all the while.
Well, that settles it for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it, Davy?&rdquo; pleaded Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean we&rsquo;re Crusoes at last, and the last link
binding us to our beloved home is swept away,&rdquo;
the other continued, for the especial benefit of Bumpus,
who was apt to take things too literally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of that, Davy,&rdquo; Thad broke in with;
&ldquo;you know we didn&rsquo;t take so much stock in that
clumsy boat, after all. It&rsquo;s true we did talk about
cutting some long setting-poles, and trying to make
the shore when the water went down, but there will
be other ways to reach the mainland when we&rsquo;re
ready, never you fear. Tell us about it, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I took my time about getting there, you
see, because I knew there wasn&rsquo;t any need of hurrying,
as we couldn&rsquo;t do a thing to-day. Besides,
Thad, I wanted to look around a little on the way,
and find out if there was any sort of game on <i>our</i>
little island. Well, there is, and I reckon, what with
our guns and snares, we could keep ourselves from
starving to death for a long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; muttered Bumpus, as though that important
statement removed a certain dreadful fear
that may have been haunting him for quite some
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the other scout glibly, &ldquo;I saw
two rabbits at different times, and a number of
nut-crackers of the gray order, fine big chaps too,
that would make a fine squirrel stew, let me tell
you. They must have come out here at some time
in the summer, when the water was awful low,
and this island connected with the main shore on
one side by an isthmus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the explanation, I expect,&rdquo; assented Allan,
who was always very much interested in all
things concerning wild animal migration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But about the boat, Giraffe?&rdquo; reminded Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, that&rsquo;s so. I started in to tell you how
I found out she was gone from that point where
we left her a while back, didn&rsquo;t I? Well, after
I got to the place where you come right out of
the woods and sight the point I began to rub my
eyes, because I couldn&rsquo;t believe I was seeing straight,
for there wasn&rsquo;t any boat on that shore at all, not
the first sign of one. Of course I knew right away
what had happened, and that it must have been
the extra big squall coming out of the northwest
that had driven her off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you hurried back to bring us the news,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; continued Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I just <i>flew</i>, because I thought the sooner
you knew about it the better. And so we&rsquo;re prisoners
on the island now, without any kind of a boat
to take us off. We may have to wade or swim after
the tide goes down again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you stopped to take a look, and
see if there were any tracks around?&rdquo; the patrol
leader continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tracks&mdash;what of, the keel of the shanty boat?&rdquo;
asked Giraffe. &ldquo;Oh! the splash of the water would
have washed all those out easy, so what was the
use? We know she&rsquo;s gone, and that covers the
whole bill. By now, what with that wind and current,
if she hasn&rsquo;t been stove in on some rock,
the shanty boat must be five or ten miles down the
river, and booming along, all the while spinning
around like a top. Whee! I&rsquo;m tickled to death to
know I&rsquo;m not aboard her right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us!&rdquo; roared several of the
scouts in unison, showing how they felt about the
matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about making a shelter?&rdquo; asked Giraffe,
his woodsman spirit aroused; which remark proved
that he must have been pondering over these things
while on the way to the upper end of the island
and back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were talking that over while you were gone,&rdquo;
said Thad, &ldquo;and came to the conclusion that while
we might try and put up some little cover good
enough for one night, which would keep the dew
off, even without the use of our ponchos, it would
hardly pay us to go to any great trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if we have to stay out here a long
time?&rdquo; continued Giraffe, whose whole manner told
that he would not object in the least, as long as
the eating was fairly good; and that the Easter
vacation could be indefinitely prolonged so far as
he was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t intend to, and that&rsquo;s all there is
to it,&rdquo; Step Hen assured him. &ldquo;Of course we have
to put in one night; but that ought to be all. The
river will fall nearly as fast as it rose; and already
Thad&rsquo;s thinking up some scheme that&rsquo;s going to
take us ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any wings to it, Thad?&rdquo; asked Giraffe laughingly;
&ldquo;or shall we make a balloon, and go flying
over Cranford, to make the folks&rsquo; eyes stick out
of their heads with wondering what those frisky
Silver Fox scouts will be doing next, to get themselves
in the spotlight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I haven&rsquo;t had time enough yet to get to
that,&rdquo; Thad told him; &ldquo;just give me a chance to
sleep over it first. But Step Hen is perfectly right
when he says we haven&rsquo;t the least intention of being
cooped up here many days. Besides, unless we do
get a move on us pretty soon, we&rsquo;ll have to turn
back home and get ready to go to school, instead
of recovering the judge&rsquo;s treasured army coat for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;School!&rdquo; repeated Bumpus; &ldquo;my goodness! is
there really such a place? Why, seems to me it&rsquo;s
been an <i>age</i> since I recited a lesson. Just the
thought of it makes me feel sad. But if we did
have to camp out here for a couple of weeks we&rsquo;d
miss some hunky-dory good times in Cranford. The
barn dance comes off next week, you know. And
every one of us, I reckon, has promised to take
somebody. Oh! we&rsquo;ve just got to be home before
then, Thad. Think what Sadie Bradley&rsquo;d do if you
gave her the mitten; and then how about Giraffe&rsquo;s
roly-poly sister, Polly, Allan; are you ready to
forsake her? Perish the thought; the boys of the
Silver Fox Patrol never were quitters, were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe, whatever he may have thought about
staying on the island as long as they could stand
it, seeing that popular sentiment was against him,
showed enough wisdom to quiet down. Possibly
he may not have been one-half as bent on such a
course himself as he made out; for Giraffe was
notoriously shrewd, and fond of playing all manner
of jokes.</p>
<p>They lounged around, some of them engaged in
accomplishing certain things, but in the main content
to lie on their blankets, with a poncho underneath
to keep the dampness off. This was on
account of the fact that they had been cheated out
of considerable sleep lately, and felt the need of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Later on Thad commenced to make a bough shelter,
with the assistance of several of the others.
In summer time this is readily done, but when the
leaves are off most of the trees it is not so easy
a task.</p>
<p>By selecting hemlock and other trees that would
afford a dense covering they managed by degrees
to build up quite a shelter, under which they might
lie without running much risk of being wet by
the dews. And after the recent heavy storm all
of the weather prophets seemed fully agreed that
the air had surely been cleared, so that another rain
was not apt to come along for some time at least.</p>
<p>Noon came and went.</p>
<p>They cooked a warm meal, thus reducing the
amount of provisions on hand; but the result was
worth all the sacrifice, Giraffe and Bumpus declared,
as they lay on the ground afterward, hardly
able to move on account of the full dinner of which
they had partaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three more meals like that, and then the
deluge!&rdquo; said Giraffe; &ldquo;but who cares for expenses?
Gimme two cents&rsquo; worth of gingersnaps, as the country
boy said when he wanted the girls in the store
to see what a high roller he could be. If our plans
turn out O. K. we hope to be where we can buy
a dinner for hard cash by that time. No need of
worrying any; keep a doin&rsquo; the smile-that-won&rsquo;t-come-off
business. We belong to the Little Sunshine
Club, don&rsquo;t we, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of them were there in the bunch, and as
usual all trying to talk at once. Davy alone sat off
to one side, and seemed to be trying to shut out
the chatter, while he wrote in his private log book
an account of their recent adventures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did the grits go, Bob?&rdquo; asked Bumpus,
who, in order to please the Southern boy, had prepared
a kettle of fine hominy, to which the other
had certainly done full justice, if his three helpings
counted for anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply immense, suh, and no mistake about it,&rdquo;
came the hearty reply; &ldquo;some of you wonder how
it is every Southerner loves that good old dish,
and I confess that I&rsquo;m unable to supply the explanation.
I only know it fo&rsquo; a fact; and that
somehow they all say it seems to bring befo&rsquo; their
minds&rsquo; eye a picture of hanging moss, orange trees,
cotton in the field, magnolias in bloom on the green
trees, and all sorts of other things connected with
the South they love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a part of this Union one-half
so fond of their section of the country as you
Southerners are, Bob,&rdquo; Allan asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re about right, suh, when you
say that. It&rsquo;s always been that way with us befo&rsquo;
the war and since. But Davy&rsquo;s beckoning to you,
Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare, what do you think of that for
pure nerve?&rdquo; muttered Giraffe, as he saw the
scout in question crooking his finger, and nodding
to the patrol leader, as though asking him to come
over; &ldquo;if the mountain won&rsquo;t come to Mahomet,
he has to go to the mountain. But whatever d&rsquo;ye
imagine ails Davy now? He don&rsquo;t look sick, and
in need of medicine, because he ate nearly as big
a dinner as&mdash;well, as Bumpus here did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, John Alden,&rdquo; retorted the
stout boy scornfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Thad understood that Davy wished to say something
privately, and on this account he did not hesitate
to get up and move over to where the other
was sitting with his log book in his hand.</p>
<p>He saw that Davy had a puzzled expression on
his face, and from this judged he had run across
some sort of enigma which he wanted the patrol
leader to help him solve. As Thad was accustomed
to this sort of thing, he did not think it strange,
though naturally feeling some curiosity concerning
the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see me, Davy?&rdquo; he asked, as he carelessly
dropped alongside the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re all here, ain&rsquo;t we, Thad, the whole
patrol I mean?&rdquo; Davy began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count noses, and you&rsquo;ll find there are just eight
of us, which covers the bill,&rdquo; Thad told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you-all were talking there did you hear
anything queer?&rdquo; continued Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that could be noticed,&rdquo; Thad told him.
&ldquo;There were times when the boys made so much
noise that it was hard for me to hear anything
besides. Did you catch any suspicious sound,
Davy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other immediately nodded, and went on to
say, at the same time casting a quick look all around
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, I sure did. I was sitting here writing,
and paying no attention to what the fellows were
squabbling about, when all at once it came, as
plain as anything, and right from over yonder,&rdquo;
with which he pointed across the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was it the bark of a dog, the mewing of a cat,
the bray of a donkey, or the neighing of a horse,
Davy?&rdquo; asked Thad, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixey, not any of those, Thad,&rdquo; replied the
other solemnly; &ldquo;but as sure as I&rsquo;m sitting here it
sounded like a shout in a human voice!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">LOOKING FOR SIGNS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you think you heard some one shouting,
do you?&rdquo; asked Thad, apparently unmoved,
though truth to tell he considered this new information
of considerable importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want you to understand, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you make out what was said?&rdquo; continued
the patrol leader, anxious to get at the kernel of
the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I don&rsquo;t believe I did; but it just struck
me it was a <i>yell</i>, like anybody would let out if
something happened to give him a shock. I reckon
that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d be apt to do if a rattlesnake jumped
at me, and I dodged back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Thad confidently, &ldquo;there
couldn&rsquo;t be any rattlesnake here on this island, I
should think, and even if that was so, snakes never
come out so early in the season. But Davy, do you
think you could tell which direction the shout
seemed to come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where I pointed, over there to the east,
which is the side of the island. Now, if there&rsquo;s
somebody out here besides us, who could it be?&rdquo;
and Davy asked this question with the confidence
the scouts had come to put in their leader, whom
they apparently expected to know everything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it might be some fisherman who had a hut
here; or even a fugitive from justice, hiding from
the officers. You know we&rsquo;ve run across things
like that. Once we even met up with a crazy man
who had broken out of an asylum, and was living
like a hermit in the woods. All that will come later
on, when we find the proof that you haven&rsquo;t made
a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Thad, I ought to know a shout given by human
lungs, hadn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; pursued the puzzled Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all think that, Davy, but you know for
yourself that a loon for instance can laugh so much
like a man that you&rsquo;d be ready to take your affidavit
there was a fellow out on the lake trying to
make you mad. You think you heard a shout;
but it may have been one of a lot of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course anybody could be mistaken, Thad,&rdquo;
the other went on to say; and it is an accepted
fact that when your enemy begins to look over his
shoulder he is getting ready to retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have heard what you think, Davy;
perhaps a boat was being swept past the island, and
someone in it, seeing the smoke of our fire, called
out for help; though I should think if that was
the case he&rsquo;d keep the ball rolling. Come, let&rsquo;s take
a turn across to the shore, and see if anything is
in sight down-river way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Thad; count on me to go along. No
need of saying anything to the rest, is there?&rdquo; Davy
remarked, with eagerness stamped upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>When the others saw them moving off, very naturally
they felt more or less curiosity to know what
was in the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! there, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; called out Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;re just going over to take a look around,
boys,&rdquo; replied Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get lost, and give us the bother of hunting
you up, whatever you do,&rdquo; they heard Bumpus
say; and the audacity of the thing struck Thad as
so comical that he could be heard chuckling as he
went on.</p>
<p>As there had been no invitation on the part of
the patrol leader to the others to come along, they
realized that they were not wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A case of two&rsquo;s company, three a crowd, I
reckon, suh!&rdquo; remarked Bob White, as he tossed a
little more wood on the fire, which felt pretty cheerful,
since the air was still cool after the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; said Bumpus, stretching himself
out again at full length on his comfortable blanket.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Thad and Davy were engaged in
making their way through the brush, and heading
for the shore on the eastern side of the island that
stood in the middle of the flooded Susquehanna.</p>
<p>They found it more difficult work than they had
expected. The island could not have been used
for any purpose, since under the trees it was a
perfect snarl of bushes and creeping vines, some
of the latter as thick as one&rsquo;s ankle. Unless the
person who was pushing his way through this wilderness
of growth kept constantly on the alert he
was very apt to catch his foot in a snake-like vine,
and measure his full length on the ground.</p>
<p>Davy, indeed, uttered several little ejaculations
when his hands came in contact with thorns growing
on some of the bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t what it seemed cracked up to be, eh,
Thad?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s a sample
of everything that grows around this region right
here on this island, and then some. And seems
like I&rsquo;m finding the same out one after the other.
There, that stub of a branch tried to poke my
left eye out, and did bring blood on my cheek. I
don&rsquo;t see how you manage to get along without
any accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not as experienced as I am in passing
through places like this, that&rsquo;s all, Davy. You
move too quick, and don&rsquo;t use your eyes enough.
If you think I can take the cake at it you ought
to see an Indian work, and after that you&rsquo;d say
I wasn&rsquo;t in the same class. He&rsquo;d like as not glide
along like a snake; and try as hard as you pleased,
you wouldn&rsquo;t hear so much as a twig break under
his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll never make a first-class
scout,&rdquo; commented Davy, &ldquo;for I seem to be too
clumsy. There, I thought that stick would bear
my weight; but it broke under me with a sharp
snap that would have told the enemy somebody was
trying to sneak up on the camp. I guess it must
run in the blood, Thad, and I haven&rsquo;t got any of it
in me. Yet I had an uncle who was said to be one
of the greatest big game hunters that ever went
out to South Africa after elephants and lions and
all such things. They skipped me when it came to
inheriting the instincts of a still-hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By degrees they forced their way through all
these obstacles, and Davy seemed to improve as he
went along, as Thad took occasion to tell him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, it&rsquo;ll be easy enough going back again!&rdquo;
Davy declared, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ve left a fair trail behind
us. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised now if some of
the other fellows take advantage of that to cross
over here, so&rsquo;s to get a squint of the river.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, here we are, and it looks as if we might
get a fairly decent look down stream, Davy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a little point sticking out here,
thank goodness. Look at all the water going past,
would you, Thad? This is a great flood, all right;
and I hope it goes down a lot before we try to
cross over to the mainland, to-morrow, or the day
after. Do you think it&rsquo;s come to a stand yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll find it that way,&rdquo; returned the
other; &ldquo;and while we&rsquo;re here I mean to make a
mark, so as to tell just before dark what&rsquo;s happening.
But Davy, can you see anything like a
boat down below?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy shook his head, for he had been earnestly
gazing in that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single sign, Thad!&rdquo; he declared, in a disappointed
tone. &ldquo;And as a boat couldn&rsquo;t have passed
from sight in this short time, why, that proves
there wasn&rsquo;t such a thing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way,&rdquo; assented the patrol leader confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Davy, &ldquo;that if I did really hear
a shout, which of course hasn&rsquo;t yet been proved for
certain, then there&rsquo;s somebody on this island besides
our crowd!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to let it go at that,&rdquo; Thad told him.
They looked about for a short time, and Thad
arranged a stick at the edge of the river, that stood
where the current would not displace it. By means
of this he could tell whether the water rose or fell,
since he had cut a groove in it to mark the present
height of the flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that ought to do the business for us,&rdquo;
Thad remarked, after he had finished his little
job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we go back to the camp now?&rdquo; Davy wanted
to know, as though a little fearful that the other
might propose a trip around the island, which, on
account of the dense thickets of brush, he would
not altogether fancy, though not the kind of a
scout to easily back down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we might as well,&rdquo; the patrol leader
told him; and with this encouragement Davy immediately
started off.</p>
<p>Thad used his eyes as he went, but could not
say that he had managed to make any discovery
that would throw the least light on the mystery of
that strange noise his companion claimed to have
heard.</p>
<p>Of course, when they joined the others, everybody
was curious to know what their little jaunt
meant; so they had to tell all about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us heard a single thing,&rdquo; remarked
Giraffe sturdily, as though that fact ought to settle
it, and that Davy must have allowed his imagination
to work overtime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you couldn&rsquo;t, what with all the
row you kept up,&rdquo; Davy answered back sturdily.
&ldquo;All I want to say is this, that I heard something
like a shout; and I&rsquo;ll keep on saying that forever,
no matter how you laugh, and make fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Of course they talked it over, and viewed the
happening from all sides. Every fellow had some
sort of explanation to make to cover the ground.
A few of these followed the same track Thad had
hewn when stating his ideas to Davy; and yet
after exhausting the subject the boys were no
nearer a solution of the mystery than when they
started.</p>
<p>Later on, just as Davy had suggested might be
the case, several of them made up their minds
they would like to take a look at the river, for Bumpus
and Smithy started forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just follow our trail!&rdquo; sang out Davy after the
pair, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t have any trouble. But keep
your eyes peeled every minute of the time if you
don&rsquo;t want to get in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What from?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus, halting in his
departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! all sorts of snares, in the shape of concealed
vines that grab you by the ankles and throw you
down; or branches that smack you square in the
face, and nearly blind you. If you get in any hole
and want help, just sing out, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, we will!&rdquo; replied Bumpus scornfully,
as though he did not anticipate such a thing happening;
if Davy considered that he and Smithy
were still greenhorns and must be treated as babes
in the woods, he was very much mistaken, that
was all.</p>
<p>As Giraffe liked to say, &ldquo;you never can tell,&rdquo; and
stranger things than that can come about when
boys are loose in the wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Those left by the fire continued to sprawl
around in favorite attitudes, and take their ease.
The day had another hour or so left, and there
was Giraffe overhauling the food supply, evidently
making out the menu which he meant to serve up
for the evening meal&mdash;trust Giraffe for taking care
of such things.</p>
<p>The sun was shining cheerily now, and that at
least was some comfort to these castaway scouts.
They expected that with the coming of another
day they would be able to start a scheme looking to
making a move to get away; and that thought gave
them encouragement.</p>
<p>It was at this moment there rang out a sudden
cry that caused everyone to spring up and look
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded like Smithy&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo; exclaimed
Thad, as he gained his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what it did!&rdquo; echoed Giraffe; &ldquo;something
must have happened after all! Mebbe they&rsquo;ve
gone and met up with trouble! Mebbe there <i>are</i>
some people on this island that don&rsquo;t like us being
here! Thad, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quick and energetic came the patrol leader&rsquo;s
order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step Hen, stay here to guard the camp; the rest
of you follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without wasting another second the five boys
rushed away toward the spot where again and
again they could hear Smithy&rsquo;s shrill voice calling
for help!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">MORE SERIOUS NEWS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Help! hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was what Smithy was calling, in agonized
tones that thrilled everyone of the other scouts.
They were rushing pell-mell along the trail which
Davy and Thad had made in going to and coming
from the river, and which the other pair had also
followed when they went to take an observation.
Now and then one of them would find a root or a
vine, and take a header, but only to scramble erect
again, and resume the furious forward rush.</p>
<p>The river was close by, and at least Smithy had
not lost his voice, for he still kept up his cries;
though getting hoarse through the excitement, and
the constant strain on his voice.</p>
<p>Then those in the lead discovered their chum. He
seemed to be lying flat on his chest at the very
brink of the swift flowing river; and while one
hand gripped an exposed root belonging to a tree,
the other was stretched over the edge of the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bumpus!&rdquo; gasped Giraffe; &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s fallen
in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>No one took the trouble to offer any objection
to this explanation. Indeed, from their previous
experience with Bumpus it seemed the most natural
thing in the world to expect the clumsy scout to
tumble overboard every chance he got. They could
in fact look back to any number of similar accidents
during the time the patrol had been taking
these outings in the woods and on the waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold him tight, Smithy!&rdquo; snapped Thad, trying
to increase his pace, which was rendered a
difficult thing to do because of the many obstacles
that must be encountered and overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Smithy, keep a-going!&rdquo; cried Davy,
greatly excited.</p>
<p>No doubt these cheery symptoms of coming help
did much to encourage Smithy to maintain his
frenzied clutch upon the one who was in the water;
for he was still holding on when Thad arrived on
the spot, accompanied by Giraffe, the best runner
of them all.</p>
<p>Down alongside Smithy they both dropped. Yes,
there was poor old Bumpus in the flood, swimming
with hands and legs, and spurting great volumes
of the muddy water out of his mouth with each
splurge. It chanced that it was quite deep there,
and the river ran like a mill race; so that if Smithy
had released his grip for a single instant the unlucky
Bumpus must have been swept down-stream
like a log, in spite of his strenuous efforts.</p>
<p>When his clothes were soaked through, the stout
member of the patrol was apt to weigh several hundred
pounds; so it was small wonder that, unaided,
Smithy could do next to nothing looking to his rescue&mdash;just
hold on desperately, and shout for help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>But when Thad and Giraffe took a grip it was
a different matter. Altogether they started to drag
the imperiled scout up out of his impromptu bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo-heave-o! Up you come, my boy! One
more pull, Thad, and we&rsquo;ve got him. Wow! what
an elephant he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Giraffe bent again to the task, with
the result that Bumpus was soon hauled over the
edge of the crumbling bank, and dragged to a place
of security. There he lay, sprawled out, gasping
for breath, and shedding gallons of water from his
soaked khaki suit.</p>
<p>The boys gathered around, staring at him. Although
they often poked considerable fun at Bumpus,
it was of an innocent sort, for they were exceedingly
fond of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you sure look like a great big grampus
hauled up on the beach!&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, with
pretended scorn, though to tell the truth in all probability
he did not really know what a grampus was,
only that it lived in the sea, and stood for something
clumsy and large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you feel like taking a bath, Bumpus,
don&rsquo;t be so greedy. You&rsquo;re some size, but the
river&rsquo;s on a flood now, and too big for you!&rdquo; said
Davy; and turning to Thad he continued: &ldquo;Like
as not your stick will show that she jumped up a
foot or more when Bumpus dropped in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad time to get your feet crossed, suh,
when you-all happen to be on a river bank!&rdquo; Bob
White hinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all away off; I didn&rsquo;t stumble, this time,
anyhow, and I wasn&rsquo;t trying to take a bath either,&rdquo;
spluttered the soaking Bumpus, as he sat up and
started wiping his face with a very wet sleeve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about that, Smithy; what happened to
him?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank caved in under him, that&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo;
replied the other scout. &ldquo;He was wanting to see
just a little further down the river, when all at
once he went in. I really couldn&rsquo;t tell you just
how I happened to catch hold of him by the back
of his coat, because I don&rsquo;t know myself; but I
thought it my duty to call out, and try to get some
help. You see, he was too heavy for me to lift.
I almost broke my back trying, as it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would!&rdquo; declared Giraffe;
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a lucky thing we heard you calling. Only
for that what would you have done, Smithy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was trying to think all the while,&rdquo; replied the
other. &ldquo;You see, I didn&rsquo;t dare let go my hold,
for the current is terribly swift here. I had half
an idea that if only I could work along the bank
a little, it might shoal some, and then Bumpus would
be able to get a footing. But I&rsquo;m glad you came
when you did, for I was rapidly becoming exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smithy generally spoke with great exactness, and
used words that few of his comrades ever bothered
with in their conversation; that was one thing connected
with his previous condition that persisted in
clinging to the former dandy of the patrol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did the right thing, and that&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo;
commented Allan; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a single
fellow who could have raised Bumpus. But, Thad,
he&rsquo;s beginning to shiver in this air; don&rsquo;t you think
we ought to get him over to the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good t-to me; fire&rsquo;s what I w-want, and
l-lots of it too!&rdquo; stammered the stout scout, trying
to get to his feet, in which effort he was ably assisted
by willing hands. &ldquo;As t-to that bank, how&rsquo;d
I k-k-know it was goin&rsquo; to c-c-cave in on me, t-t-tell
me that, will y-y-you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried him along as fast as he could be
urged, and all the while he kept shedding little
streams of water, as though he carried an almost
inexhaustible supply. When finally the camp was
reached, with the wondering Step Hen giggling
over the comical sight Bumpus presented, they
made the late swimmer disrobe, and hung his clothes
around so that they would dry in the heat of the
fire.</p>
<p>Bumpus himself was wrapped in blankets until
he looked like a swathed mummy, and told to just
lie there. Under all this manipulation of course
his chilled blood regained its normal temperature,
and he declared he felt as snug as a &ldquo;bug in a rug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even this excitement did not cause Giraffe to forget
that he had business on his hands, and supper
was taken in charge with the customary results;
for they presently found themselves sitting down to
a &ldquo;bountiful repast,&rdquo; Davy called it, to the evident
complete satisfaction of the eminent cook.</p>
<p>By the time they were ready to roll up in their
blankets and try to get some sleep, the clothes hanging
from various bushes were thoroughly dry; so
that Bumpus could don the same. This released
all the extra blankets with which he had been
swathed, which was a matter of vital importance
to their various owners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>The fire they expected to keep going more or less
all through the night. Besides the comfort that
it brought through the necessary heat, its bright
glow did much to dissipate the gloom around them,
and render their situation less cheerless.</p>
<p>Giraffe insisted on keeping his gun close at his
side, for he said there could be no telling whether
they were safe there or not. If the island did
happen to be the hiding-place of some desperate
criminal, who might think to steal a march on
them as they slept, he wanted to be ready to repel
boarders.</p>
<p>He even had Thad promise to give a certain signal
should anything out of the way happen while
they slept; just as though Thad would be awake all
through the night, and know about the same.</p>
<p>But the long hours of darkness dragged on, and
there was no alarm. Some of the boys slept through
the entire night without arousing once; but there
were others who felt more of the weight of responsibility
resting upon them, and who frequently
sat up to look around, or else got upon their feet,
in order to put more wood on the camp fire.</p>
<p>Morning broke and found them apparently in
just the same condition as when they had wrapped
their blankets around them, and lay down with
their feet toward the fire, hunter-fashion.</p>
<p>Thad was the first up, and when Allan awoke
it was to see the patrol leader returning over the
trail that led to the river bank.</p>
<p>It was easy to decide that the other must have
been over to learn what his tally-stick had to tell
about the condition of the flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Thad; falling, I hope?&rdquo; Allan
asked, as he stretched himself, after getting on his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and rapidly into the bargain, just as we
expected would be the case,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;That
rain could not have extended all the way up to
the sources of the river, you see; and it will run
out in a big hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may be able to get across to the mainland
before a great while?&rdquo; queried Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that while we&rsquo;re eating breakfast,&rdquo;
Thad told him; &ldquo;and as the sun is coming
up I reckon we&rsquo;d better waken the rest of the
crowd. They&rsquo;ve had a grand good sleep, I take
it. Give Giraffe a push, Allan, will you, and roll
Bumpus over a few times till he says he&rsquo;s awake;
that&rsquo;s the regular program with him, you know.&rdquo;
One by one the scouts sat up, and yawned, and
stretched, as sleepy boys are apt to do when they
have not been allowed to have their last nap out.
Of course Davy did not forget how Thad had
made a flood-tally over at the river, which fortunately
Bumpus had not kicked away when he
took his unexpected plunge with a portion of the
crumbly bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon, now, Thad, you&rsquo;ve been over to see
what&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; he remarked, while Giraffe fixed his
cooking fire, and set about beginning operations
looking to having breakfast under way. &ldquo;And if
that&rsquo;s so tell us how she stands. Did it drop half
a foot or more during the time we snoozed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More like three feet,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;and
if Bumpus fell over in the same place again he&rsquo;d
find the water hardly up to his waist, with little
current in place of that mill race of yesterday. Yes,
things begin to look encouraging all around, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun they do!&rdquo; bawled out Giraffe just
then, as he stood up, and turned a very red and
angry face toward the rest of the scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what ails you now, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked
Smithy, who, generally calm and cold as an iceberg
himself, frequently took the others to task
when they showed signs of great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as mad as a wet hen, I tell you, and I wish
somebody&rsquo;d kick me for not doing what I first meant
to last night, ask Thad to set a watch!&rdquo; exploded
the tall scout, stamping on the ground, and grinding
his teeth.</p>
<p>Thad smelled a rat immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything been taken, Giraffe?&rdquo; he asked hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything?&rdquo; roared the other; &ldquo;why, there isn&rsquo;t
half enough left to give us a decent meal. I reckon
I might be satisfied, but where the rest of you are
going to come in beats me. Yes, this island is inhabited,
all right, and they&rsquo;re a set of low-down
thieves at that. You hear me talking, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE TRAIL OF THE MARAUDER.</span></h2>
<p>When they heard the dreadful news the rest of
the scouts looked almost frightened. It was bad
enough to know that some evil intentioned man was
on the island with them; but that he should have
actually crept into their camp while they slept,
and very nearly made a clean sweep of their already
limited stock of provisions, seemed close to
a tragedy. When you threaten to cut off their
food supply it is hitting boys in their weakest place.</p>
<p>There was an immediate start for the spot where
they had placed their haversacks and the food on
the preceding night. Thad, however, held them
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t all rush so,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;We want
to look around, and see if we can find out anything.
If everybody tramples the ground it&rsquo;ll be
little use trying. Let Allan and Giraffe help me
look first. We&rsquo;ll report anything we find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The advice sounded reasonable to the rest; so
despite their eagerness to take a hand in the game
they held back while the three scouts proceeded to
examine the ground.</p>
<p>It was not long before Allan made a discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think here&rsquo;s where he crawled along,&rdquo; he told
Thad, who was close by; &ldquo;you can see that something&rsquo;s
dragged here, which must have been his
knees. Yes, and there&rsquo;s where the toe of his shoe
made a dent in the soil, with another and still another
further on. And now he lay flat on his
stomach. Perhaps one of us happened to move
just then, and he was afraid of being seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Allan,&rdquo; remarked Thad, after taking
a good look; &ldquo;and to think it possible he was
crouching here in the shadows when I got up and
threw some wood on the fire. If I knew that I&rsquo;d
feel pretty sore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he went on again pretty soon, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
observed Giraffe, who was hovering close by, and
keeping close watch on everything that was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what he did,&rdquo; resumed Allan, also
starting on once more, following the tracks that
looked so strange they would have sorely puzzled
members of the patrol like Smithy and Bumpus,
who were not noted as trackers; &ldquo;and headed direct
for the place where we stacked our things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a lucky thing none of us happened to
leave our guns here with all the rest of the duffel,&rdquo;
observed Giraffe exultantly, as though it gave him
considerable satisfaction to find that he had not been
quite as foolish as might have happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He finally got to our stuff,&rdquo; Allan went on,
&ldquo;and rising to his knees started to pick out what
he wanted. I guess he must have been pretty hungry,
because grub was what he seemed to be after.
Not one of our haversacks is gone, you can see.
He took that piece of bacon we fetched from the
boat, the packages of crackers, and&mdash;yes, the cheese
is lost in addition, also a can of corn and the coffee.
Fact is, it looks as if we didn&rsquo;t have much
left, outside this package of hominy, and the little
tin box of tea you fetched along, Thad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe gave vent to a hollow groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just dreadful, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; he said, with a
gulp, as though receiving the sad news that he had
lost his best friend; &ldquo;just think of grits and tea for
our breakfast, and not another thing! The worst
is yet to come, though, for we won&rsquo;t get <i>anything</i>
for dinner, you know! Why, I&rsquo;ll be all skin and
bone if things keep on going from bad to worse
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob White won&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so tough, if he can
have his grits,&rdquo; remarked Allan; &ldquo;but breakfast to
a New England boy stands for ham and eggs, flapjacks
with maple syrup, and always coffee and cold
pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop stretching out the agony, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Giraffe, holding both hands to his ears as though
trying to shut out the mention of such delightful
dishes; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s cruelty to animals to talk that way,
Allan. But, Thad, what are we going to do about
this same thing? Can&rsquo;t we take up the trail, and
try to get our stuff back? After all, this old island
is only of a certain size, and with eight of us in
line we ought to comb it from top to bottom. I
feel like Sheridan did when he met the Union
troops running away in a panic from Cedar Creek,
and yelled out: &lsquo;Turn the other way, boys, turn
the other way! We&rsquo;ll lick &rsquo;em out of their boots
yet! We&rsquo;ve just got to get those camps back!&rsquo;
You see he was thinking of all the good stuff they&rsquo;d
lost with the camps. So are we.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Allan, suppose we look to see which way he
went off, because it couldn&rsquo;t have been along the
same line as his advance?&rdquo; suggested the scout master.</p>
<p>He knew considerable about these things himself,
but trusted to Allan to learn facts that might even
have eluded his observation. Allan had been in
Maine and the Adirondacks a portion of his life,
and picked up many clever ways from association
with the guides that made him invaluable when
it came to a question of woodcraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Thad,&rdquo; was what the other
said in reply; and already his sharp eyes had begun
to look for signs.</p>
<p>These were easily found, for the unseen thief
had crawled away in the same fashion as he made
his advance, though a bit more clumsily, which was
doubtless owing to the fact of his being more heavily
laden at the time.</p>
<p>Step Hen, Bob White and the other three were
of course watching the every movement of the experienced
trackers with great interest. They took
some little satisfaction in trying to guess just
what each movement signified. Bumpus and
Smithy of course would never have been able to
figure these things out, but the other three had
more practical knowledge and could hit closer to
the mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Step Hen was saying eagerly; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
taking stock of what&rsquo;s been hooked, and my stars!
just look at the way Giraffe throws his hands up,
will you? If that doesn&rsquo;t tell the story, then I&rsquo;m
away off in my guess. I just wager we&rsquo;ve been
cleaned out for keeps, and our little tummies will
call in vain for their accustomed rations. I wonder
how it feels to starve to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! quit talking that way, Step Hen,&rdquo; wailed
Bumpus; &ldquo;we ain&rsquo;t going to waste away like all that.
Give Thad a chance to think up how to win out.
Besides, didn&rsquo;t you hear Giraffe say there was
lots of fat game on this island; yes, and fish in
the river to boot. I&rsquo;m not going to give up so easy;
there&rsquo;s always <i>something</i> to fall back on, if it gets
to the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Step Hen maliciously, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what
shipwrecked sailors have to do when they cast
lots; and I&rsquo;m glad now I wasn&rsquo;t built like a roly-poly
pudding. It&rsquo;s too tempting when hard times
come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus, of course, understood that his chum was
only joking, but nevertheless he drew a long breath,
and remained very quiet for quite some time after
that, as though busied with uneasy thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re starting off again,&rdquo; remarked
Davy, &ldquo;and I guess it&rsquo;s to follow the trail of the
thief away. I wonder if we could track him to
where he hangs out, so as to make him hand over
our property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I allow, suh,&rdquo; Bob White broke in with, &ldquo;that
by the time we did that same there would be mighty
little of our food left. He must have been pretty
hungry to take the chances he did when he crawled
into our camp, and with all these guns around in
plain sight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep along after the boys,&rdquo; suggested Step
Hen, &ldquo;and see what they run up against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea appealed to his companions, for they
all started off, though maintaining the same relative
distance from Thad and his backers, so as not
to interfere with the work. Step Hen took occasion
to bend down when he came upon a spot where
the imprint of the unknown man&rsquo;s knee could be
seen, and looked at it intently, though finally giving
it up as a task beyond his ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knees all make the same kind of dragging mark
to me,&rdquo; he told the others, who had waited to hear
his report, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t tell one from another. If
it was Bumpus here, now, who had done this trick
in his sleep, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say for sure,
though like as not he&rsquo;d bear deeper&rsquo;n this mark
shows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since Bumpus wasn&rsquo;t outside of his blanket
once all night long, you can&rsquo;t saddle this job
on his poor shoulders. He&rsquo;s got enough to carry
as it is, see?&rdquo; and the stout boy put all the emphasis
possible on that last word, as though he
meant to make it decisive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be getting close to the bushes
now,&rdquo; Bob White observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And once he got in there mebbe the thief would
rise to his feet to walk away,&rdquo; added Step Hen.
&ldquo;If Thad beckons you&rsquo;ll know he&rsquo;s settled it in his
mind to follow the trail, and wants all of us who
own guns to rally around him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the rest; what will they be doing?&rdquo;
asked Smithy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tending camp, of course,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;Think now we know we&rsquo;ve got a thief for a neighbor
we want him to steal our blankets next? A
nice pickle we&rsquo;d be in without some way to keep
warm nights. Remember, if you are left on guard,
to defend the blankets with your very lives, both of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sort of lurid talk of course thrilled Bumpus
very much, for he had a habit of taking what
the others said literally, and could not see the
vein of humor apt to lie back of bombastic vaporings.
He was rubbing his fat hands one over
the other in a nervous way, and alternately watching
what Step Hen did, and then how the others
were coming on.</p>
<p>They could see that Thad and his two fellow
scouts were just back of the first fringe of bushes.
They had possibly made some sort of discovery,
because all of them seemed to be down on hands
and knees, with their faces close to the earth, and
apparently examining certain impressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; ventured Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve run on something that&rsquo;s staggered the
bunch, you can see easily enough,&rdquo; Step Hen went
on to say excitedly; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m trying to make up
my mind whether after all it <i>was</i> a man crawling
along that made those queer marks. P&rsquo;raps, now,
some sort of big wild animal might have done it.
We haven&rsquo;t seen a single footprint, you remember,
to tell the story. I wish I knew what they&rsquo;ve run
across. Why don&rsquo;t they call us over, and let us
in? It isn&rsquo;t just fair to keep us worrying like we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Just as though Thad might have heard this complaint
on the part of Step Hen, he turned toward
them, and raising his hand beckoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, boys, he wants us to come over!&rdquo; exclaimed
Davy, exultantly; &ldquo;I thought it&rsquo;d strike us
pretty quick; Thad isn&rsquo;t the kind to forget his mates.
And we&rsquo;ll soon be put wise to the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried to join the other three, who still
stood at the same place, ever and anon looking seriously
down at the ground, as though hardly able to
believe the evidence of their eyes.</p>
<p>When Step Hen came running with the other
four tagging at his heels, Thad held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on right there, boys!&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t want you to cut in and rub it all away before
you&rsquo;ve had a chance to look for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course this caused them to turn their attention
to the ground, and it was easy to see that
the crawling thief had here risen to his full height,
though possibly bending over more or less as he
continued his retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was a man, after all!&rdquo; was what Bumpus
said; and there was a positive air of relief
about his voice, as though he had taken Step Hen&rsquo;s
hint seriously, and even fancied a terrible wild
beast might be hovering near them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but look closer, and see if you can recognize
anything familiar about the marks?&rdquo; advised
Thad.</p>
<p>Accordingly, all of them leaned over and looked.</p>
<p>It was Step Hen who gave the first startled
cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Thad, what does this mean?&rdquo; he burst out
with; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the same broken shoe, bound together
with an old rag, that we saw when we looked for
the marks of Wandering George, in the mud of
the road; but how in the wide world could he get
over here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">SOLVING A MYSTERY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; burst out Davy, looking
as startled as though, to use the words of Giraffe,
he &ldquo;had seen his great grandfather&rsquo;s spook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wandering George! Out here on our island,
too!&rdquo; gasped Bumpus, just as though they had a
permanent right to the strip of land in the middle
of the river&mdash;&ldquo;our&rdquo; island he called it.</p>
<p>Of course all of them turned toward Thad, as
usual, expecting him to give the answer to the
question that puzzled them. The patrol leader
laughed as he pointed down once more to that tell-tale
track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No going behind the returns, is there, boys?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Every one of you knows that footprint by
heart, because we took the pains to study it. And
the man whose old battered shoe is being held on
with a rag we know is Wandering George. He is
responsible for taking our provisions. Right now
you can imagine how much he&rsquo;s enjoying that cheese
and crackers we expected to last us out to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that fine strip of bacon we lifted at the
time we left the shanty-boat!&rdquo; added Step Hen,
with a dismal look toward Bob White, who raised
his eyes as if in horror at the idea of such desecration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to understand that the hobo&rsquo;s on the
island, but how in the wide world could he get here
without wings? That&rsquo;s what I want to know,&rdquo; Allan
observed; which at least went to show that so far
no one had been able to figure it out, for if anybody
could, surely the Maine boy, who had followed
many a difficult trail in his time, ought to be able to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he crossed over to the island when the
water was low?&rdquo; suggested Step Hen, but the idea
was instantly scorned by Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that the river&rsquo;s been on the boom
for some little while,&rdquo; he said loftily; &ldquo;and we
happen to know that George wasn&rsquo;t far ahead of
us just yesterday. Now, you&rsquo;re wondering if I&rsquo;ve
got a theory of my own, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
think. Somehow or other George must have been
in a boat, and came that way. How do we know
but what he was trying to cross over, and the current
swept him down stream? Then, again, he
might have been in some house or barn that was
carried away by the flood, and managed to get
ashore here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Thad, don&rsquo;t you remember what I told you
last night, when the rest were making so much
noise, and I was dead sure I heard a shout?&rdquo; interrupted
Davy, with considerable excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe; &ldquo;well, that might
have been the time he landed here, and discovering
that we wore uniforms, he was afraid to break
in, so like as not he just hung around and watched
us, till he got a chance to sneak all our bully grub.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, you haven&rsquo;t told us what <i>you</i> think yet,&rdquo;
remarked Smithy, who had been listening to all
this excited talk, and hearing so many wonderful
suggestions made that he was quite bewildered;
&ldquo;did this tramp fly over here; was he washed up
on the island by the flood; or did he find himself
castaway on some floating cabin, and manage to
get ashore by good luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad must have been using his head to some
advantage during this time, for he appeared to have
made up his mind decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
take any stock in either the flying scheme or the
one that brings in a floating hencoop or cabin to
account for Wandering George&rsquo;s being here. I
feel pretty sure he came on board a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so, Thad?&rdquo; Giraffe went on to remark;
&ldquo;what kind of a boat would you say it was, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! something in the shape of a shanty-boat!&rdquo;
continued the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean like the one that brought us here?&rdquo;
demanded Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The same one!</i>&rdquo; Thad shot back, with an emphasis
that staggered his hearers, since all sorts
of exclamations burst from their lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, do you really mean that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be like you to crack a joke, when
we&rsquo;re all mixed up like this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A passenger aboard <i>our</i> boat, and none of us
ever dream of it; well, I must say you&rsquo;ve got me
guessing, Thad. However could that be?&rdquo; and
Bumpus plucked at the sleeve of the patrol leader,
as though thrilled through and through by the
staggering announcement just made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it&rsquo;s just dawned on me,&rdquo; Thad
commenced to say, &ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t had much time
to figure it out myself, but the more I think it over
the stronger my belief grows. Look back a bit, and
you&rsquo;ll remember that we found a light in the cabin
when we boarded the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so, Thad,&rdquo; assented Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And supper cooking, too,&rdquo; added Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With not a soul in sight, which we thought
mighty queer,&rdquo; Step Hen went on to say, as his
contribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the while we stayed there, up to the
time the cable broke, there was never a sign of the
man that owned the boat, either,&rdquo; Davy reminded
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; Thad continued, &ldquo;that we
figured out at first the owner of the boat must
have seen us coming, and hid himself somewhere
ashore, hoping we&rsquo;d take a look about and pass on.
We even guessed he must have some reason to fear
arrest, and thought we were connected with the
state militia. But after learning of Wandering
George&rsquo;s being here on the island I&rsquo;ve hatched up
another idea, and I&rsquo;ll tell you just what it runs
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Thad; we&rsquo;re listening like everything,&rdquo;
muttered Bumpus, at the elbow of the chief
scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion,&rdquo; Thad began, &ldquo;that
the two tramps must have chased the owner of
the shanty-boat away some time before we struck
in. Now that I&rsquo;m on the track I can remember
there were certain signs of confusion aboard when
we first entered; things seemed tossed around, as
if someone had been looking in places for hidden
valuables. That would be just what these two
yeggmen were apt to do, you see. And while one
began to cook some supper, the other may have
started in to ransack the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and about that time they glimpsed us coming
along; is that the way you figure it out, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Allan eagerly; for this explanation on the
part of his chum appealed strongly to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they saw a bunch of fellows in khaki running
toward the boat,&rdquo; pursued the scout master;
&ldquo;and as it was too late for them to make a safe
getaway, they just lifted a trap in the floor of the
cabin, and dropped into the hold of the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Je-ru-sa-lem!&rdquo; gasped Giraffe, &ldquo;now, what d&rsquo;ye
think of that? All the time we were aboard the
old boat George and his pal were hiding in the hold,
and waiting for us to vacate the ranch! Thad, I
honestly believe you&rsquo;ve struck oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposed Step Hen, who on this occasion
seemed disposed to be the only doubter, &ldquo;why
wouldn&rsquo;t they have made some attempt to escape
while we slept, before the flood got so bad that
the boat broke away from her moorings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been some reason,&rdquo; Thad told
him; &ldquo;and we may be able to give a stab at it, even
if we never know the real truth. If you look back
again, Step Hen, to how we were sprawled about
on the floor of that little cabin, trying to get some
sleep, and wrapped in our blankets, you&rsquo;ll likely
remember that the eight of us managed to cover
about all the limited space there was around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Every foot of the floor, for a fact, Thad,&rdquo; Davy
admitted; &ldquo;and I even threatened to hang by my
toes from a hook, and sleep like a bat does, only
Giraffe told me all the blood would run to my head,
because that was the only empty place in my makeup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody must have been lying on that
trap door, and whenever the men below tried to
raise it they understood there was nothing doing,&rdquo;
Thad explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that carries it up to the time we broke
loose, and started on our wild ride down the flood,&rdquo;
Step Hen admitted; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d have
let us know about having passengers aboard. Whenever
we bucked up against a rock, and the bally old
tub threatened to turn upside-down, think how
scared George and his pal must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been. Whew! it
was bad enough above-decks, let alone being shut
down there, and not knowing what was happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can&rsquo;t tell you what they thought,
and why they didn&rsquo;t try to communicate with us,&rdquo;
Thad went on. &ldquo;It might be they felt that if they
had to choose between giving themselves up or
staying down in the hold and taking their chances
they&rsquo;d prefer the last. But when we left the boat
I honestly believe they were aboard still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;d guess she had struck shore, from
the steady way she hung there,&rdquo; Giraffe continued,
taking up the story in his turn, &ldquo;and of course
they knew that we were clearing out. So, what
did they do but follow suit, as soon as they thought
the coast was clear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about it now. Step Hen; any more objections?&rdquo;
asked the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m through, Thad,&rdquo; acknowledged the
other slowly, as though still unable to fully grasp
the strange thing; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve made out a pretty strong
case, and I don&rsquo;t glimpse a break in the chain.
That&rsquo;s the way you always hammer it in. If that
hobo is here, then chances are he did come along
with us, even if we never smelled a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the excitement of getting away,&rdquo; Thad resumed,
&ldquo;I forgot I&rsquo;d noticed cracks in the cabin
floor that looked like a trap leading down into the
hold of the boat. That was partly why I had Giraffe
go back to where we left the shanty-boat.
You remember he came and told us it had been
driven off the point by that big squall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering what would have happened if
you&rsquo;d thought about the hold under the cabin before
we ever quitted our old craft?&rdquo; Giraffe remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;d have found what was down there,
and with guns in our hands could have easily cowed
the hoboes,&rdquo; Allan told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight or no fight, that&rsquo;s what we would have
done!&rdquo; declared Bumpus vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to him, will you?&rdquo; chuckled Step Hen;
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t he just the fierce Cossack, though? I can
see that tramp army wilting when they sighted
Bumpus threatening to jump down on &rsquo;em. Who&rsquo;d
blame anybody for throwing up the sponge rather&rsquo;n
be mashed flat by such a hippo?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, as he rubbed his hands
together in a satisfied fashion, &ldquo;one thing sure, our
old luck&rsquo;s still hanging on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out, Giraffe?&rdquo; inquired
Smithy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started on this hike with the idea of overtaking
the tramp who was wearing the coat the
judge&rsquo;s wife gave away by mistake, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
the lengthy scout demanded. &ldquo;Well, stop and think
for a minute, will you, what&rsquo;s happened to us?
Here we are, marooned on an island, from which
nobody can get away right at present unless he
swims, and none of us feel like trying that in such
cold water, do we? Did you ever know a hobo who
would willingly take a bath? Well, put things together,
and what do you get? Wandering George,
coat and all let&rsquo;s hope, is shut up here on this strip
of ground with us; and all we&rsquo;ve got to do is to
round him up to-day. Now, do you see, Smithy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow this plain way of putting the case appealed
to every one of them; for immediately Bumpus
was shaking hands with Step Hen, and as if
to show their satisfaction over the way things
were turning out some of the rest did likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course,&rdquo; said Giraffe, as he gave Davy&rsquo;s digits
a squeeze that made the other fairly wince, &ldquo;we
can&rsquo;t say just how we&rsquo;ll corner the slippery rat, but
there&rsquo;ll be a way, make up your mind to that, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">AN EMPTY LARDER.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only afraid it&rsquo;ll be too late, Giraffe,&rdquo; Bumpus
was heard to remark, with a skeptical air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late for what?&rdquo; demanded the tall scout,
who had dropped to his knees, and was starting to
follow the trail left by Wandering George, after
the latter had gained his feet, and moved away from
the vicinity of the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there won&rsquo;t be a sign of our grub left by
that time, you see; George; he&rsquo;ll be awful hungry,
and it&rsquo;s surprising what a lot of stuff a regular hobo
can put away when he tries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hoboes ain&rsquo;t the only ones, Bumpus,&rdquo; intimated
Davy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d match you and Giraffe here
against the best of &rsquo;em. But let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ll find
a way to get off this island before night comes, and
strike a farmhouse where they&rsquo;ll feed us like the
Baileys did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! do you really think there&rsquo;s a chance of that
happening to us, Davy?&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus, intentionally
omitting to show any ill feeling on account
of the little slur concerning his appetite. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be
willing to even go without my lunch in the middle
of the day if I could believe we&rsquo;d be sitting with
our knees under a groaning table to-night. Seems
like when you&rsquo;re beginning to face starvation every
good thing you ever liked keeps popping up in your
head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Giraffe at this juncture called out, and his manner
indicated that he had made a discovery of some
sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just bet you he&rsquo;s found where George sat
down and ate up every crumb of that grub,&rdquo; muttered
Bumpus, whose mind seemed to be wholly
concerned with the question of the lost supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George was joined here by his pal, who must
have been hanging out, waiting for him,&rdquo; Giraffe
told them; and as he examined the tracks further
he added; &ldquo;and say, I reckon now that second
fellow got hurt some way, while he was cooped
up in the black hole under the cabin floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now how do you make that out, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked
Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I can see that he limps like everything,&rdquo;
the other went on to say, doubtless applying his
knowledge of woodcraft to the case. &ldquo;One foot
drags every step he takes, and it didn&rsquo;t do that
before, I happen to know. That&rsquo;s why George volunteered
to do the cribbing all by himself, while
the other waited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes two to handle instead of one, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; Allan remarked; and once more Bumpus
groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two is a whole lot worse than one, to get away
with things,&rdquo; he observed, with a piteous air of
resignation, as though he was now perfectly satisfied
they would none of them ever see the first sign
of the stolen provisions again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a trail why can&rsquo;t we start in, and
track the two hoboes down?&rdquo; suggested Davy vigorously.</p>
<p>They had followed Giraffe, so that all of them
were just back of him at this time. The tall scout,
however, shook his head in a disappointing way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try that the worst kind,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;but I reckon it&rsquo;s no go. You can hardly
see the footprints here, and they get fainter as
they go on. Besides, we&rsquo;d make all manner of noise
creeping through this scrub, and they&rsquo;d be wise to
our coming, so they could keep moving off. There&rsquo;s
a better way to capture George than that, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Thad, &ldquo;we can comb the island
from one end to the other. It can&rsquo;t be of any great
size, you see; and by forming a line across at the
top we could cover about every foot of it. In the
end we&rsquo;d corner the tramps, and make them surrender.
We&rsquo;ve got the whole day before us,
and the sun promises to shine, too, so we can count
on its being warmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole day,&rdquo; Bumpus remarked disconsolately,
&ldquo;that means twelve long hours, don&rsquo;t it?
Well, I suppose I can stand the thing if the rest
of you can; but it&rsquo;s really the most dreadful calamity
that ever faced us. They say starving is an easy
death, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>No one was paying any attention to his complainings,
so Bumpus stopped short in order to listen
to what the others were saying. Possibly he told
himself that the best way to forget his troubles
was to get interested in what was going on. And
it might be there still remained a shred of hope
in his heart that if they made a quick job of the
surround, and capture, perhaps they might retake
enough of the purloined food to constitute a bare
meal at noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all we&rsquo;ve got to have our breakfast,
such as it is,&rdquo; Thad observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea and grits&mdash;oh! my stars!&rdquo; sighed Giraffe;
whereupon Bob White turned upon him with the
cutting remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be thankful for the grits, suh,
believe me; it satisfies me, let me tell you. I
wouldn&rsquo;t give a snap fo&rsquo; all the tea in China or
Japan; but grits make bone and muscle. You can
do a day&rsquo;s work on a breakfast of the same. Only
it takes a long time to cook properly, suh; and
the sooner we get the pot started the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You attend to that, Bumpus, please,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
&ldquo;and be sure you get enough to satisfy the
crowd, even if you have to use two kettles, and the
whole package of hominy. I want to talk things
over with Thad here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus hesitated for a minute. He hardly knew
which he wanted to do most, stay there and listen,
or return to the fire and begin operations looking
to the cooking of that forlorn breakfast.</p>
<p>Finally, as he received a message from the inner
man that it was time some attention was paid
to the fact that nature abhorred a vacuum he turned
away and trotted toward the camp fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Giraffe, together with Thad and Allan, tried to
follow the trail of the two tramps further, but
soon gave it up. After all, the several reasons why
they should turn to the other way of rounding up
the concealed men appealed strongly to them.</p>
<p>Later on they returned to the camp, to sit around
and wait for their breakfast to cook. Nobody
looked very cheerful that morning. Somehow the
fact that they were isolated there on that island
with only one meal between them and dire hunger,
loomed up like a great mountain before their mental
vision.</p>
<p>In the end they found that grits did satisfy their
hunger remarkably well; and taking Giraffe&rsquo;s advice
Bumpus had actually cooked the entire amount
on hand, so there was plenty to go around three
times.</p>
<p>The tea was another matter, for they had neither
sugar nor milk to go with it, and although each
fellow managed to drink one cup, some of them
made wry faces while disposing of the brewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of warms you up inside,&rdquo; commented
Davy, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the only reason I try to get it
down; but, oh! you coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, none of that, Davy,&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;scouts
have to make the best of a bad bargain, and never
complain. We&rsquo;d be feeling lots worse if it wasn&rsquo;t
for this breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suh, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied, and feel as if I&rsquo;d
had the pick of the land,&rdquo; Bob White remarked
stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you like the stuff, and I never would
eat it at home,&rdquo; complained Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time you began to know what good things are,
then, suh,&rdquo; the Southern boy told him plainly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Even Bumpus admitted that he felt very good
after they had emptied both kettles of the simple
fare. For the time being he was able to put the
dismal future out of his mind, and actually smile
again.</p>
<p>Thad had not told them as yet what plan he was
arranging with regard to hunting down the tramps
who were on the island with them, and of course
most of the scouts were eager to know.</p>
<p>Accordingly, after the meal was finished, they
began to crowd around and give the scout master
hints that they were waiting for him to arrange
the details of that &ldquo;combing&rdquo; business he had spoken
of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a simple matter,&rdquo; Thad remarked.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to the place where the shantyboat
went aground, and make our start from there,
gradually stretching out until we cover the island
from shore to shore, and in that way pushing our
quarry further along toward the lower end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; pursued Giraffe, following the plan in
his mind, &ldquo;as the hoboes will of course object to
taking to the water, we&rsquo;ll corral the pair in the
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you reckon they&rsquo;ve got any sort of gun
along, Thad?&rdquo; asked Step Hen; though it was not
timidity that caused him to ask the question, for
as a rule he could be depended on to hold his own
when it came to showing fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, of course, about that,&rdquo; he was
told; &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s often the case that these tramps
carry such a thing, especially the dangerous stripe
like this Wandering George seems to be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t pull any gun on the farmer, when
Mr. Bailey caught him robbing his desk, you remember,
Thad?&rdquo; Davy mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he upset the lamp, and then skipped
out, leaving the inmates of the farmhouse to fight
the fire, which was a cowardly thing to do,&rdquo; Bumpus
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten about the chances of them
being armed when I spoke of forming a line across
the island, and searching every foot of the same,&rdquo;
Thad explained; &ldquo;and the way we&rsquo;ll be safe in
doing that I&rsquo;ll explain. Now, we ought to leave
two fellows to look after the camp, with a gun
between them. The rest can be divided up into
three squads, each couple having one of the other
guns. We&rsquo;ll manage to keep in touch with each
other, as we work along, zigzag-like, and a signal
will tell that the game has been started. Do you
understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plain enough, Thad,&rdquo; Giraffe told him, as he
picked up his gun, and in this way signified that
he was ready for the start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! but who&rsquo;s going to be left behind?&rdquo; Bumpus
wanted to know; his whole demeanor betraying
the fact in advance that he could give a pretty
good guess as to who <i>one</i> of the unfortunates might
prove to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be wiser for me to appoint
you and Smithy to that post of honor,&rdquo; he was
immediately informed by Thad; &ldquo;and you want to
understand it is just as important that you do your
duty well here, as that we carry out our part of
the game. A scout never asks why he&rsquo;s told to do
a certain thing, when perhaps he&rsquo;d like to be in another
position. Whether he serves as the hub, the
tire, or one of the spokes, he feels that he&rsquo;s an important
part of the whole wheel, and without him
nothing can be done. There&rsquo;s just as much honor
in guarding the camp as in creeping through the
tangle of vines and scrub bushes. And, Bumpus,
I&rsquo;m the one to judge who&rsquo;s best fitted for that sort
of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, I&rsquo;m not saying a single word,&rdquo; expostulated
the stout scout; &ldquo;fact is, if you come right
down to brass tacks, I&rsquo;m satisfied to stay here,
rather than scratch my way along, and p&rsquo;raps break
my nose tumbling. And I&rsquo;m sure Smithy is built
the same way. I hope you&rsquo;ll let me hold the gun
you leave with us, which ought to be my own repeating
Marlin, because it&rsquo;s already proved its
worth. And, Thad, you remember I shot it with
some success the time we were out there in the
Rockies after big game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a fair bargain, Bumpus,&rdquo; he was told
by the scout master; &ldquo;and you can consider it a
bargain. We&rsquo;ll look to hear a good report from
you when we come back to camp again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with our prisoners in charge, too,&rdquo; added
the confident Giraffe.</p>
<p>Bumpus saw them depart with a gloomy look,
as though he felt that all chances of winning new
laurels had been snatched away when he was ordered
to keep camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">DRAWING THE NET.</span></h2>
<p>Whenever Thad Brewster started to do anything
he went about it in a thorough manner. He
was no believer in halfway measures, which accounted
for much of the success that had crowned
his efforts in the past, as those who have read
former books in this series must know.</p>
<p>He arranged the beating party in such a way
that Giraffe and Davy went together; Allan had
Step Hen for a companion; while the Southern
lad accompanied Thad himself.</p>
<p>Having given the camp keepers a few last instructions,
with regard to remaining on the alert,
and listening for any signals such as members of
the Silver Fox Patrol were in the habit of exchanging
while in the woods and separated, Thad led the
way toward the upper end of the island.</p>
<p>They found no trouble in arriving there. The
river had indeed fallen very much, and the flat
rock upon which the nose of the shanty-boat had
been driven by the fierce current was now away
out of the water. Had the craft remained where
it struck it would be high and dry ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>The boys would not have been human had they
not first of all looked yearningly toward the shore,
between which and themselves rolled a wide stretch
of water. Still, as the sun shone brightly, and the
air was getting comfortably warm, the outlook did
not seem anything like that which they had faced
on the preceding morning. And, besides, they had
just eaten a breakfast that at least satisfied their
gnawing hunger, and that counted for considerable.</p>
<p>Thad did not waste much time in looking around,
but proceeded to business. He had already apportioned
his followers, so that everyone knew who
his mate was to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allan, you and Step Hen take the right third;
Giraffe, cover the left side with Davy; and we&rsquo;ll
look after the middle,&rdquo; he told them, in his quiet
yet positive way, that caused the words to sink in
and be remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in case we run across George and his pal
we&rsquo;re to give a yell; is that the game, Thad?&rdquo; asked
the lengthy scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our old shout that we know so well, don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo;
he was told. &ldquo;An ordinary whoop isn&rsquo;t
enough, for somebody might let out that kind if
only he tripped and felt himself falling. If you
want me to come across, bark like a fox three times.
In case you get no answer, repeat the signal; and
if that doesn&rsquo;t fetch me, call out my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on, Thad; is that all?&rdquo; Giraffe asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>With that they were off, three pair of eager human
hounds, bent on discovering the hiding-place
of the tramps who had for so long been hovering
just ahead of them like one of those strange lights
in swampy marshes, a jack-o&rsquo;-lantern they call it,
that keeps eluding your grasp, now appearing here,
and then vanishing, to crop up suddenly in another
place.</p>
<p>To begin with it seemed easy enough to move
along. The scrub was not very dense at the upper
end of the island, for some reason or other, but
seemed to get heavier the further they advanced.</p>
<p>Acting on the suggestions of Thad, each couple
spread out a little more as they continued to push
on, although remaining in touch with one another.
In this way it was possible to cover more ground
than by keeping close together.</p>
<p>Giraffe was certainly in his element. He kept
his gun-stock partly under his arm, and was ready
to elevate the weapon at a second&rsquo;s warning; in
fact, as he prowled along in this way the tall scout
looked the picture of a hunter expecting feathered
game to flush before him, which he must cover instantly,
or expect it to place obstacles between, as
a woodcock always will.</p>
<p>Davy did not like to roam along entirely unarmed,
and hence he had hunted up a club, which
he gripped valorously. He kept just a little behind
Giraffe, if an imaginary line were marked
across the island from shore to shore. This was
because he wished to allow the one who held the
firearm a full sweep of territory in case he found
occasion to shoot, or even threaten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Now and then Giraffe would speak to his companion,
as a rule asking him to &ldquo;kindly give a poke
in that patch of bushes, where it looks like a man
might find it easy to hide&rdquo;; or &ldquo;peek into that hole
between the rocks, Davy&mdash;don&rsquo;t be afraid a bear&rsquo;ll
come out at you, &rsquo;cause there ain&rsquo;t any such good
luck waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By giving various signals the boys managed to
maintain something like a straight line as they
pushed on. They could see one another frequently,
too, which enabled them to keep from forging
ahead in any one place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the crows cawing, will you?&rdquo; Giraffe
presently remarked, as though the noise of the
flock might be sweet music to his ears, since it
told of the life in the open which Giraffe dearly
loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a noisy lot, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; remarked Davy;
&ldquo;whatever d&rsquo;ye s&rsquo;pose ails that bunch of crows,
Giraffe? Would they scold that way if they just
happened to see a pair of hoboes eating breakfast,
d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it might be they would,&rdquo; the other replied
thoughtfully; &ldquo;and come to think of it they&rsquo;re
somewhere down below us, ain&rsquo;t they? Hunters
often know when game is moving by the signs in
the sky; for birds can see down, and they talk, you
know, in a language of their own. I&rsquo;ve often wished
I could understand what crows said when they
scolded so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just there Davy began to move away from his
partner again, as he tried to cover his share of the
territory; so conversation died out temporarily between
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>They had passed the place where the camp fire
burned, with Bumpus and Smithy watching their
movements eagerly. The thick brush now hid the
camp from their sight, and what lay before them
they could only guess.</p>
<p>Once more Davy drew close to his mate, thrusting
his club to the right and to the left, in the endeavor
not to leave a stone unturned in clearing up
the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever do you think they&rsquo;ve gone, Giraffe?&rdquo;
he asked, as though beginning to feel the strain of
the suspense that hung over them, as they continued
this strange hunt for the tramps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my honest opinion,&rdquo; the other replied, &ldquo;that
we ain&rsquo;t going to see a sign of &rsquo;em till we get away
down to the other end. And they didn&rsquo;t come
through here, either, because we&rsquo;d have run across
some sign to tell us that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how could they reach the lower end of
the island?&rdquo; demanded Davy quickly, thinking he
had caught Giraffe in a hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they made off to the beach after they
got the stuff, and trailed down that way, which
you can understand must have been the easiest, all
things considered,&rdquo; the tall scout went on to explain.
&ldquo;I believe in applying that old principle, and
figgering what you&rsquo;d have done if it had been you.
And anybody with horse sense&rsquo;d know it was lots
easier tramping on the shore, to this way of breaking
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, Thad thought we ought to do it?&rdquo; Davy
remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thad was right, as he nearly always is,&rdquo; Giraffe
pursued doggedly; &ldquo;because this is the only way we
can make dead sure. I&rsquo;ve got a hunch that they
built a fire and proceeded to cook a warm meal.
Want to know what makes me think so? Well,
we had an extra box of matches along, and that
went with the rest of the things. George knew
he needed it. Long before now they&rsquo;ve had their
fire, and it&rsquo;s all day with that grub of ours. We&rsquo;ll
get it back when we surround the hoboes; but you
won&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they won&rsquo;t surrender when we ask
&rsquo;em?&rdquo; Davy wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d better go slow about that same,&rdquo; he was
immediately told, as Giraffe shook his head energetically;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got the law on our side, you see,
after that pair breaking into the farmhouse the way
they did, and showing themselves to be regular
robbers as well as tramps, yeggmen they call that
kind. If I pinked George, after seeing him threaten
me, I couldn&rsquo;t be held responsible for the same.
When a man is a fugitive from justice, and the
long arm of the law is stretched out to grab him, he
hasn&rsquo;t got any rights, you understand. Every man&rsquo;s
hand is against him, and he&rsquo;s just got to take his
medicine, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe had a little smattering of legal knowledge,
and he certainly did like to hear himself talk, given
half a chance. Just then Davy seemed to be glad
to learn certain facts, upon which he may have been
a little hazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I hear you talking with Step Hen the
last time you crossed over to his line; or no, it
must have been Bob White, because he&rsquo;s with Thad
in the middle track?&rdquo; Giraffe asked, a short time
later, as once more he and his partner came into
touch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was Bob speaking to me,&rdquo; admitted the
other, &ldquo;and what d&rsquo;ye think, he said he believed he
had discovered a bee tree, and only wished we
would be here long enough to get a chance at the
honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what next, I wonder?&rdquo; ejaculated Giraffe,
with the air of one who had received especially
good news; &ldquo;I always did say I liked honey about
as well as anything that grew; but, then,&rdquo; he added,
as though seized with a sudden depressing remembrance,
&ldquo;what good would all the wild honey going
do a fellow when he hasn&rsquo;t got a cupful of flour to
make a flapjack with, or a single cracker to eat
with the nectar? Oh! rats! but this is tough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; Davy continued, &ldquo;Bob, he said the
tree was a whopper for size, and the hive was
away up in a dead limb that we couldn&rsquo;t well reach;
so I guess that winds it up for us this trip. And
as you say, Giraffe, what good would just plain
honey do a starving crowd? Give me bread before
you try to plaster me with honey. Still, it&rsquo;s queer
how many things we keep finding on this same
island, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes another rabbit right now, Davy;
and I could have knocked him over as easy as you
please, if I was hunting something to eat, instead
of <i>men</i>! They always do say what strange things
you do see when you haven&rsquo;t got a gun; and with
us it runs the other way; for we&rsquo;ve got a shooting-iron,
but dassen&rsquo;t use the same for fear of alarming
our human quarry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do manage to put things before a fellow
the finest way ever, Giraffe,&rdquo; Davy told him; &ldquo;and
some of these days I expect to see you making a
cracking good lawyer, or an auctioneer, or something
that requires the gift of gab. But seems
to me we&rsquo;ve been poking like this for a long time
now. How much further d&rsquo;ye think the island
runs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some longer&rsquo;n I had any idea would be the
case,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe; &ldquo;but I reckon we&rsquo;re shallowing
up now. The shore line looks to me like
it&rsquo;s beginnin&rsquo; to draw in closer, every time I make
the beach. If that&rsquo;s so we ought to come together
down at the lower end before a great while now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what if we do get there and never once
sight George and his pal, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw! don&rsquo;t be trying to get off conundrums on
me, Davy; I never was much good guessing the
answer,&rdquo; the tall scout went on to complain. &ldquo;It
don&rsquo;t seem like that could happen, because they&rsquo;re
here on our island, and we sure haven&rsquo;t left a
single place unsearched where a fox could hide.
Don&rsquo;t borrow trouble, my son. We&rsquo;re bound to
corral the pair down at the lower point; and they&rsquo;ll
throw up their hands when they see us coming, six
abreast, with guns leveled and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Giraffe; I hope it turns out that way;
but I&rsquo;m not feeling as sure as you are. Something
seems to keep on telling me we&rsquo;re due for a big
surprise, and I&rsquo;m trying to shut my teeth, so as to
be ready to meet it like a scout should always meet
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>He had hardly said the last word when a large
object jumped almost under Davy&rsquo;s feet, upsetting
him completely. And as he fell over, nimbly turning
a complete back-somersault, for Davy was as
smart at such things as any circus performer, he
managed to bawl out wildly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear! Bear! why don&rsquo;t you shoot it, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE SMOKE CLEW.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bear nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed the scout who held
the gun.</p>
<p>He had instinctively elevated the weapon at the
first sound of alarm from his ally; and had it been
necessary Giraffe was in a position to have given
a good account of himself, for he was known to be
a somewhat clever shot.</p>
<p>Just in time, however, he had managed to get a
better view of the creature that Davy had stumbled
upon, losing his balance in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, then, Giraffe, if not a bear? Don&rsquo;t
tell me it was a dog,&rdquo; demanded the other, having
righted himself after his somersault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear him grunt as he ran away?&rdquo;
asked the lengthy one contemptuously; for he might
have pressed the trigger of his gun only that just
in time his ears had been greeted with the sound
in question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grunt? Great C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s ghost! was that a <i>hog</i>?&rdquo;
almost shrieked Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it was, a dun-colored hog, and a rousing
big critter in the bargain, let me tell you, Davy.
I saw him as plain as anything, and he ran back
of us, you noticed, so we won&rsquo;t be apt to raise
him again in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;d an old grunter be doing out here,
tell me, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! how d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;d know?&rdquo; returned
the other. &ldquo;Expect I&rsquo;m up in the hog lingo just
because I did say I always wanted to understand
crow talk? Why, for all we know, that hog&rsquo;s been
living here since last summer; or else he&rsquo;s another
flood victim, and got washed up like we did.
They&rsquo;re all doin&rsquo; it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, who&rsquo;d expect to run up against a
porker?&rdquo; Dave went on to say, as he sought to grasp
the full significance of the adventure, having by
now recovered from the shock the sudden surprise
had given him. &ldquo;And Giraffe, if a hog this time,
what next will we run across? P&rsquo;raps there might
be chickens, and cows, and all sorts of things close
by? Mebbe the old island&rsquo;s inhabited, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure,&rdquo; Giraffe went on to say, in a
satisfied tone, &ldquo;this beats out Robinson Crusoe by
a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As how, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any comparison between hogs and goats
when it comes to making a good dinner?&rdquo; demanded
the other. &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see what this means
to us, Davy? No use talking about going hungry
as long as there&rsquo;s such noble hunting on this little
patch of ground. Me to bag a prize hog, when the
right time comes. Hams, and sweet little pork
chops, and smoked shoulders&mdash;oh! we could live a
week off that buster, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>He smacked his lips, as though the prospect gave
him unlimited pleasure. Davy himself had known
the time when the slaughter of a three-hundred
pound hog afforded no occasion for showing more
than passing interest; but that was when starvation
did not stare him in the face. Circumstances alter
cases; and he was almost as much excited over the
outlook now as the always hungry Giraffe seemed
to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we know that this place we&rsquo;ve been
calling an island isn&rsquo;t connected with the mainland?&rdquo;
was Davy&rsquo;s next suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; demanded his ally, as they
started on once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there might be some sort of a link, you
see, a sort of isthmus, so to call it, along which
the hog made his way, and where we could skip out
of the trap; how about that, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, Davy,&rdquo; came the scornful reply;
&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t we see that the river ran past on both sides
like a mill race? Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t do that if the
way was blocked by a strip of land, would it? Not
much. We&rsquo;re marooned on a sure-enough island,
and you can&rsquo;t get around that. Course we might
run across a cow yet; same time we&rsquo;ll keep our
eyes peeled for a breadfruit tree, and coffee bushes,
and truck gardens. Nothing like being hopeful
through it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can hogs swim, Giraffe, do you happen to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you get me there,&rdquo; returned the other.
&ldquo;I never saw one doing the same; but seems to me
I have heard of such a thing. They can do nearly
anything, and so swimming may be on their list. I
only hope the old chap don&rsquo;t take a notion to clear
out of here before I get a crack at him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was only going to say that we might capture
the old grunter, and hitch him to a log on which
the whole lot of us perched, making him tow the
same ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Giraffe understood Davy was only joking
when he said this, but he chose to pretend to
take it seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you leave it to me to choose, Davy,&rdquo; he went
on to say gravely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer to have those hams
and the bacon, and take my chances of paddling
ashore afterward. Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve
got anything to make harness out of, so your great
scheme would fall kind of flat. Give that bunch
of bushes another whack with your club while
you&rsquo;re about it, will you? We want to clear up
things as we go along, so we&rsquo;ll know the job&rsquo;s been
done gilt-edged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like that&rsquo;s an open place ahead, Giraffe,&rdquo;
ventured Davy, after he had complied with the request,
and found nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does seem that way, Davy, and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
now we&rsquo;ll have a chance to look around a bit when
we strike it. I was just wondering whether the
river could have been up over all this island any old
time in the past, and here&rsquo;s the evidence of the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to what looked like drift stuff caught
in the crotch of a tree. It may have been lodged
there years back, but anyone with observation could
readily see that it had been carried to its present
location by a moving current.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As true as anything, Giraffe, and there must
have been three feet of water over the highest
ground on the island then. Lucky the rain stopped
when it did, or we might be perched in trees right
at this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Thad was saying, when he told us
it was never so bad but what it might be a whole
lot worse. Think of the bunch of us being compelled
to roost in trees day and night, till somebody
came along in a motorboat and rescued us.
Well, for one, I&rsquo;m glad things didn&rsquo;t get quite
that bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they drew closer to the open spot they could
see the other scouts advancing on their right, and
covering the ground. They exchanged signals, and
in this way learned that nothing had thus far been
seen of those for whom they were searching.</p>
<p>Thad drew them together at this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From here on we&rsquo;ll be much closer,&rdquo; he told
them all, &ldquo;because it looks as though the end of
the island must be just a little ways off, and it seems
to come to a point like the upper end. Look over
there, what do you call that?&rdquo; and he pointed directly
ahead as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo; announced Old Eagle Eye instantly.</p>
<p>Everyone was ready to confirm his announcement,
after they had taken a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as there couldn&rsquo;t be smoke without a fire,
and no fire unless some human hand had started
it,&rdquo; the scout master continued, in his logical way,
&ldquo;it looks as if we might be closing in on those we&rsquo;re
hunting for, Wandering George and his pal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since they&rsquo;ve had a fire that means the
finish of our grub,&rdquo; commented Giraffe; &ldquo;but then,
it&rsquo;s only what we expected; and, Thad, there&rsquo;s a
great big hog on this island&mdash;no, don&rsquo;t laugh, because
I&rsquo;m not referring to Bumpus now. I mean
a real porker, a whopper of several hundred pounds
weight. Davy stepped on him, and I could have
knocked the beast over as easy as turning my hand.
So we don&rsquo;t need to have any fear of being starved
out, if it gets to the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds good to me, Giraffe, and I can see
that you&rsquo;re not joking,&rdquo; Thad told him. &ldquo;We heard
some sort of a row over your way, but thought it
was only one of you tripping over those creepers.
A hog may not seem like very fine company, but
that depends on conditions. Just now we&rsquo;ll be glad
to know him, and to offer him the warmest seat
close by our fire. Fact is, we&rsquo;ll take him as a companion,
and let him be one of us. Now, let&rsquo;s make
our line again, for we want to push down toward
that fire below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another patch of scrub ahead, before we
get to the point of the island, and we might lose our
game in that if we didn&rsquo;t keep the net drawn across,
for a fact,&rdquo; admitted Allan, who of course recognized
the wisdom shown by the leader in continuing
the carrying out of his plan.</p>
<p>Once more they separated, but this time it was
not necessary to put much ground between them.
When the line had formed all eyes were turned
toward Thad. He waved his hat, which was the
signal to begin the advance; so again each scout
moved on as before, examining every possible cover
for signs of the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>They had thus made a clean sweep of the island.
Rabbits may have escaped them by hiding in crannies
among the rocks; and squirrels could have remained
aloft in their nests inside hollow limbs of
trees, or secreted amidst the foliage of the evergreen
hemlocks; but certainly no larger object had evaded
them.</p>
<p>As they continued to close in on the spot where
the smoke arose, the scouts very naturally felt more
or less the thrill of excitement. They knew full
well what it meant, for many times in the past the
same queer sensation had almost overpowered them.</p>
<p>This chase had been in progress long enough now
to have aroused their hunting instincts. That the
old blue army coat should eventually be returned
to the judge was to most of them a small affair,
for they of course did not know the real reason why
its recovery mattered to the former owner; but
they had somehow set their hearts on accomplishing
the object they had in view. And the more
difficulty they met with in doing this, the stronger
their desire grew.</p>
<p>The trees became more sparse, so that before long
they caught glimpses of the fire itself. It was not
burning very briskly, though sending off considerable
in the way of smoke, a fact that convinced
the scouts these hoboes knew nothing concerning
woodcraft, and the habits of Indians in making
fires of certain kinds of dry fuel that hardly send
up any smoke at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Now the scouts, having finished their &ldquo;combing&rdquo;
process, began to gather together for the final rush.
They had reached the open ground, where no object
half the size of a man could evade them, so
they felt they need have no fear of either one of
the hoboes passing by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see one of them lying there, like he might be
asleep, Thad,&rdquo; whispered one of the scouts; and of
course it could be taken for granted that it was
Giraffe, of the eagle eye, who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second fellow may be on the other side of
the fire, back of the smoke,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen;
but somehow neither Thad nor Allan could believe
this, because the smoke was drifting that way, and
they knew very well no one willingly places himself
on the leeward side of a smudge like that, suffocating
in its effect.</p>
<p>The further they crept the more concerned did
Thad and the Maine boy become. They could see
the sleeping tramp by now, and it was with more or
less uneasiness they realized the fact that he must
be other than Wandering George. Besides, not the
first sign of the blue army overcoat did they discover
anywhere.</p>
<p>While thus preparing to close in on the sleeping
tramp, and give him a very unpleasant surprise,
the scouts were feeling stunned over the mysterious
disappearance of the man they had been following
so far, and whom they felt sure must have
been on that very island only a comparatively few
hours before.</p>
<p>Thad kept hoping that the second hobo would
start up from some place when they made their
presence known; and it was in this expectation that
he finally swung his hat, which started his five
companions on a hasty run toward the smoking
fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE CAPTURE.</span></h2>
<p>The scouts had been eagerly awaiting this motion
with the hat on the part of the patrol leader.
It acted on them about in the same way the bang
of a starting pistol might with a string of nerve-strained
sprinters, anxious to leap forward, with a
prize in view to the first under the tape.</p>
<p>Many times before had they found themselves in
just this same position, with Thad deciding the
start. Giraffe, the fastest in the bunch, was
crouched in his accustomed attitude, looking somewhat
like a big, wiry cat getting ready to spring;
while Bob White, Step Hen, Allan and Davy Jones
each had assumed an attitude best suited to his particular
method of starting.</p>
<p>At the same time all of them understood this was
not going to be a race. They had been instructed
to spread out a little, after the manner of an open
fan, as they advanced. This was to give the tramp
as little chance to escape as they possibly could.</p>
<p>Well, the hat, after being poised for a few preliminary
seconds in mid-air, was suddenly swung
downward with a violent dip. That meant in the
plainest of language &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; and every fellow made
a forward move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Giraffe had been given one of the outer lines,
since that meant he would have a little more ground
to cover; and no one was better fitted for this than
the lanky scout. Nature had built him for a runner
from the ground up; he did not have a superfluous
ounce of fat on him, but was all muscle,
and, as Giraffe often proudly declared, his flesh
was &ldquo;as hard as nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a pretty sight to see those five fellows in
khaki begin to spread out in that systematic way,
just as though each one might consider himself a
part of a machine.</p>
<p>Thad had purposely taken the center, so that he
could keep an eye on every part of the field. It is
always considered the best thing for a captain on a
baseball club to be posted somewhere in the diamond,
preferably on third base, as that gives him
a chance to watch the game closely. It also allows
him the opportunity of running in frequently and
arguing with the umpire over disputed plays.</p>
<p>So far nothing had happened to warn the dozing
tramp of their coming. All of the boys had gotten
under way without a single mishap in the line of a
stumble, which would serve to warn their intended
victim.</p>
<p>He was still sprawled out alongside the warm
fire, and doubtless enjoying himself in true hobo
style, caring nothing as to what went wrong with
the world, so long as he did not miss a meal.</p>
<p>Thad would have been much better satisfied could
he have glimpsed that badly wanted army coat
somewhere around; but its absence, although to be
regretted, must not interfere with the programme
he had laid out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>The distance from the shelter of the brush to the
fire was not very great, and could have been covered
speedily only for the desire on the part of the
scouts to take the man by surprise.</p>
<p>Step Hen spoiled this by an unfortunate stumble,
which was rather singular, because as a rule he had
proved sure-footed. It chanced, however, that Step
Hen was watching the reclining figure by the fire
so closely that he did not notice some obstruction
lying in his path, so that the first thing he knew
he caught his toe, and measured his full length on
the ground.</p>
<p>Of course that spoiled the surprise part of the
game. Thad knew it instantly, as the tramp&rsquo;s head
came up, and accordingly he uttered a quick command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rush him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that each scout jumped forward, eager to
be the first to close in on the enemy. Those who
had guns displayed them threateningly, while the
others waved their clubs in a way that needed no
explanation as to what use they expected to make
of the same presently.</p>
<p>If the actions of the invaders of the hobo camp
were rapid the same could be said concerning the
movements of the lone inmate. He must have
realized the desperation of his position the very
instant he sighted those advancing boys in khaki,
with such a ferocious display of various weapons of
defense and offense, for like a flash he scrambled to
his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>As it was hardly to be expected that the tramp
had prepared himself against a surprise like this,
the chances were he acted solely from impulse.</p>
<p>Giraffe fully expected he would try and go
around their outermost guards, and with memories
of similar tactics employed on the gridiron he
changed his course somewhat in order to cut off this
flight.</p>
<p>It was a mistake, for the fellow never once endeavored
to flee. Instead of this he leaped over
to a pile of rocks that chanced to lie close by, forming
a species of pyramid. The boys saw him throw
himself into the midst of this, even while they were
rushing forward, though they could not anticipate
what his scheme might be.</p>
<p>Events are apt to happen with lightning-like
rapidity under such conditions as these, and the first
thing the boys knew there was a sharp report as
of a pistol, and a puff of smoke burst from the pile
of rocks that thrilled them to the core.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a gun!&rdquo; snapped Giraffe, looking to
Thad to give the order to send back as good as they
received.</p>
<p>It was a time for quick thinking. The tramp was
evidently a desperate sort of fellow, who, finding
himself in danger of arrest, meant to stand out to
the end. He may not have tried to injure any of
them when he fired that shot, but all the same it
gave the boys a chill, and several of them involuntarily
ducked their heads, as if they fancied the hobo
had picked them out for his target, and that they
had heard the whiz of the lead past their ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Thad sized up the situation in that speedy way of
his. Occasions sometimes crop up that call for the
promptest kind of action; and surely this looked
like one of that kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allan, keep on in the center, and I&rsquo;ll turn his
flank!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Bend down, everybody, and
get behind a rock if you can. We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to
land him, that&rsquo;s all there is about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even while saying this the scout master was on
the jump, and, passing Allan as well as Bob White,
he sped toward the edge of the water, making a
half circle.</p>
<p>There was another sharp report from the rocks,
but, although the boys held their breath while
watching their leader run, they rejoiced to see that
he gave no sign of having been injured by the
tramp&rsquo;s firing.</p>
<p>Every boy was keyed up to what Giraffe would
call &ldquo;top-notch&rdquo; condition; doubtless hands quivered
while they clutched gun or club, and hearts beat
with the rapidity of so many trip-hammers. But
to their credit it could be said that not one of them
as much as looked back over their shoulders, to see
if the way for retreat was open. That spoke well
for their courage, at least.</p>
<p>Thad reached the spot which he had set out to
attain, and instantly whirled, to aim his gun toward
the rock pile. It was just as he had anticipated,
for the tramp, while sheltered on the one side, was
fully exposed on that looking down the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender, or it&rsquo;ll be the worse for you!&rdquo;
shouted Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump him, boys!&rdquo; roared Giraffe, utterly unable
to keep back a second longer, while his nerves
were quivering in that furious fashion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>When Step Hen and the other four saw the impetuous
right end start straight toward the rock
pile, they gave a shout, and proceeded to imitate his
example. Boys are a good deal like sheep in many
ways, and when one takes a venture he is certain
to be copied by others.</p>
<p>From all sides they were thus closing in rapidly
on the hobo who was at bay, and every fellow was
giving vent to his excitement in shouts and screeches
calculated to complete the collapse of the tramp&rsquo;s
defiance.</p>
<p>He knew when he had had enough. Serious
though arrest might appear to him under the present
conditions, it would be a dozen fold worse
should he fire that weapon of his again, and succeed
in injuring one of these brave lads. Besides,
he must have been more or less influenced by the
handy way they carried those guns.</p>
<p>This being the case, the tramp at bay suddenly
threw up both his hands, at the same time bawling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! don&rsquo;t shoot; I&rsquo;m all in, gents; I surrender!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The furious shouts now ceased, since the object
of their rush had apparently been accomplished.
Thad, however, was too smart a leader to lose any
advantage that fortune had placed in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw out that gun!&rdquo; he called in his sternest
voice; &ldquo;and be quick about it, if you know what&rsquo;s
good for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hastened to obey the order. No doubt
he understood that his captors were only boys; but
there may be circumstances where cubs are just
as dangerous as full-grown men; and this is the
case when they happen to be provided with firearms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come out here, and keep your hands up!&rdquo; continued
the patrol leader, who did not trust the fellow,
and while speaking he kept his gun leveled so
that it bore straight upon him.</p>
<p>The hobo looked disgusted, as well he might at
finding himself a victim to such humiliating conditions,
with boys his captors. He scowled darkly as
he left the partial shelter of the rocks, and advanced
several paces toward the scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Thad told him; &ldquo;now lie down on
the sand on your face, and put your hands behind
you. We&rsquo;ve got to tie your wrists, you understand.
Here, don&rsquo;t think to play any trick, because we
won&rsquo;t stand for it! Down on your knees, and over
you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that such a young chap was not to be
trifled with, the tramp, muttering to himself, did as
he was ordered. Lying there on his chest he pushed
both hands behind his back, and crossed his wrists,
just as though this might not be the first time he
had run up against a similar situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe, you fix him up!&rdquo; said the patrol leader,
for the lengthy scout had a reputation as an expert
in tying hard knots, and was never known to be
without more or less stout cord on his person.</p>
<p>It had come in handy many a time in the past,
as Giraffe could explain if asked, and he produced
his coil now with a satisfied grin that told how much
he enjoyed his new job.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>After Giraffe had completed the fastening of the
hobo&rsquo;s big wrists, there was not one chance in a
thousand the fellow could free himself, even if he
were a second Houdini, capable of slipping handcuffs
from his person by doubling up his pliable
hands.</p>
<p>This done, Giraffe got up, and helped the man rise
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave yourself now, and we&rsquo;ll treat you white,&rdquo;
he told him; &ldquo;but just try to make trouble, and see
what you get, that&rsquo;s all. But, Thad, where d&rsquo;ye
reckon his pal has disappeared to, that he ain&rsquo;t
around here? We covered every foot of the island
from the other end, and didn&rsquo;t scare him up. Half
a loaf may be better than no bread, but we didn&rsquo;t
come after this fellow at all. We want Wandering
George, and we want him bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad himself was bothered to tell how the second
tramp had disappeared. If the ground had
opened and swallowed him he could not have vanished
more completely; and apparently there was
only one source of information open to them. This
was the prisoner, who stood there, listening to what
they were saying, and trying hard to conceal a grin
that would creep over his face in spite of him.
That very cunning expression convinced Thad the
man knew the important fact they wanted to find
out, if only they could force him to speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">FORCED TO TELL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your partner?&rdquo; asked Thad, turning
suddenly on the prisoner.</p>
<p>The tramp tried to look at him as if in surprise.
Undoubtedly he was hugging the one hope to his
heart that as long as his companion remained foot-free
there might be a chance for his release. That
idea of self-interest was undoubtedly the only thing
that would account for his desire to remain mute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My partner?&rdquo; he went on to say, as though not
understanding what was meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the man who was with you, Wandering
George, the fellow who wore the blue army overcoat
that was given to him by a lady in Cranford
a few days ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you mean him, does you?&rdquo; the hobo replied,
with a knowing nod; &ldquo;that guy gimme the slip
yesterday, and never divvied with me either. I&rsquo;d
like right well to set eyes on George myself, and
that&rsquo;s no lie. I got a bone tuh pick with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling what isn&rsquo;t true, now,&rdquo; said Thad
severely. &ldquo;We happen to know that you two came
here in the hold of the shanty boat we were on.
Last night George crept into our camp, and got
away with nearly all our food stuff. There&rsquo;s a
piece of the bacon right now, Giraffe, which ought
to please you some. What have you got to say
about that, Mr. Tramp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was me sneaked your camp, kid; I was nigh
starved out, and nawthin&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t keep me from
takin&rsquo; chances,&rdquo; the other boldly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell that to the marines!&rdquo; Giraffe blurted out.
&ldquo;Thad, you don&rsquo;t believe him, do you? We know
better than that, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who crept into our camp had a rag
tied around his right foot to keep the torn sole of
his shoe on,&rdquo; Thad went on to say positively, as
though clinching matters beyond all question; &ldquo;and
we can see that both your shoes are fairly decent,
so it couldn&rsquo;t have been you. Besides, there were
two pairs of tracks making the trail. You waited
for him back of the bushes, and both went off together.
Now, you see how foolish it is trying to
yarn out of it. Where is George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked into that flushed but determined
face. He saw something in those steady eyes that
convinced him the leader of these boys in khaki was
not the one to be further trifled with.</p>
<p>So he gave a nervous little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you sure got me twisted up, and kinked
tuh beat the band, kid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I got a pal, jest
as you sez, an&rsquo; his handle is George. But jest
where he might be at this minit is more&rsquo;n I c&rsquo;n say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s on the island, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; demanded Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shore is, &rsquo;less he&rsquo;s took a crazy notion to try
an&rsquo; swim over tuh the shore, which wouldn&rsquo;t be
like cautious George a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was here with you, how long ago?&rdquo; asked
Allan; &ldquo;you must have cooked breakfast this morning
with that fire, and he sat right here, where I
can see the mark of his broken shoe. Where did
he go, and when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want to know!&rdquo; added Giraffe
sternly.</p>
<p>The tramp saw that he was cornered. One by
one his defenses had been beaten down. These
energetic boys would not stand for any further
holding back on his part; and unless he wished to
invite rough treatment it was now up to him to tell
all he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, George was sittin&rsquo; there, as you sez,
younker, an&rsquo; he takes a sudden notion that he wants
tuh find out what the rest o&rsquo; the folks of this island
&rsquo;spected to do so&rsquo;s tuh get away. That bein&rsquo; the
case, he sez to me, sez he: &lsquo;I reckons I&rsquo;ll stroll up
a ways, and take a look around. If there&rsquo;s anything
doin&rsquo; in the boat line we might want tuh cop
it, and clear out.&rsquo; And so he goes off, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t
seen the first sign o&rsquo; George since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago might that have been?&rdquo; asked
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been asleep nearly all the time since, so how
could I tell?&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By looking at the sun,&rdquo; the patrol leader told
him; &ldquo;you know how high it was when George went
away. And hoboes never have any need of a
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cept to hock, and get cash on the same, kid,&rdquo;
the man remarked, with a grin, at the same time
casting a quick glance upward; &ldquo;well, I reckon it
might &rsquo;a&rsquo; been all o&rsquo; an hour back when George,
he passed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other in some perplexity.
Since they had certainly covered the whole island,
they could not understand how it came they had
missed the other tramp. He was a big fellow, and
could not have hidden in any hole among the rocks
that they had noticed. The mystery bothered them,
from Thad down to Step Hen and Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if he did take a notion to try and swim
for it?&rdquo; suggested the latter, as Giraffe was scratching
his head, and looking in a helpless fashion at
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one chance in a thousand that way,&rdquo; replied
the patrol leader; &ldquo;I call myself a fairly good
swimmer, but I&rsquo;d hate to take the chances of that
current, and the rocks under the surface. No, he
must be on the island still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whereabouts, Thad; didn&rsquo;t we cover the
ground, every foot of it, while we came down
here?&rdquo; pleaded Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder, now?&rdquo; Thad was saying half aloud,
as though a sudden inspiration had broken in upon
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Thad?&rdquo; begged Giraffe; &ldquo;sounds like
you&rsquo;ve got an idea, all right. Let&rsquo;s hear it, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way we could have missed
him,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;and that would mean he
hid in a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There arose a series of exclamations from the
other scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;ye think of that, now?&rdquo; cried Giraffe,
apparently taken aback by the suggestion;
&ldquo;we kept our noses turned to the ground so much
none of us ever bothered looking up, did we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Thad, the leaves ain&rsquo;t on the trees yet, so
how could he hide from us? Do you mean he got
behind a big limb, and lay there like a squirrel?&rdquo;
Davy demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget there are some hemlocks on the
island, and every one of us knows how easy it
would be for a fellow to hide in their bushy tops
any time of year,&rdquo; Thad told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo; snapped Giraffe, always
wanting action, and then more action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go back again, and find him, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; said Thad, with a look of grim determination
on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this fellow?&rdquo; remarked Allan. &ldquo;Do
we want to trot him along with us?&rdquo; and he jerked
his thumb at the prisoner as he said this.</p>
<p>Thad considered for a short time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be poor business, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; he
concluded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better leave him here until we
want him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got more strong cord,&rdquo; Giraffe suggested;
&ldquo;and we could tie him to a tree, like the Injuns
used to do with their captives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there ain&rsquo;t any need tuh do that, boys,&rdquo; argued
the hobo, who apparently did not fancy such
an arrangement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set right here, and never
move while you&rsquo;re gone, sure I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make certain that you stay where we leave
you,&rdquo; Thad told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Giraffe only waited for the word, and immediately
backed the tramp to a tree that seemed suited
for the purpose. Then he wound the cord around
as many times as it would go, and tied it in hard
knots. As the hobo still had his hands fastened
behind him, and could not begin to get at the knots
with his teeth, it looked as though he would have
to stay there until the scouts were pleased to release
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what, Thad?&rdquo; asked the energetic Giraffe,
picking up his gun again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back the same way we came,&rdquo; the other replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Covering the ground, you mean, only this time
we&rsquo;ll look into every tree in the bargain; that&rsquo;s the
programme, is it, Thad?&rdquo; asked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the boys began to spread out, and in this
manner was the captured tramp left behind. He
realized that it was useless trying to influence them
to change their minds, and so resigned himself to
his fate.</p>
<p>Giraffe had secured the remains of the strip of
bacon, and was dangling this from his left hand as
he went along. Apparently he did not mean to take
any chances of it getting away from him again;
and of course Bob White noted his action with a
nod of appreciation.</p>
<p>It was slow work now, because they had to investigate
each likely tree that was approached.
Some of these were of a type calculated to afford
a refuge for anyone who wished to hide. Several
times one of the boys, usually the spry Davy, was
sent aloft to make sure the object of their search
was not hiding there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Thad began to wonder if anything could have
happened at their camp. He remembered that they
had left the two weakest scouts on guard, and this
worried him.</p>
<p>Often as he pushed on, Thad had strained his
hearing, dreading at the same time lest he catch
sounds of serious import. But beyond the chatter
of the crows that flew scolding ahead of them, and
the scream of an early red-headed woodpecker tapping
at a rotten tree trunk, there was no sound, unless
he took into consideration the fretting of the
water sweeping past outlying spurs of the island
shore.</p>
<p>They had passed nearly halfway when Giraffe
beckoned to the leader, without saying a single
word, upon which Thad of course hastened toward
him.</p>
<p>When the lanky scout pointed to the ground,
Thad immediately turned his eyes in that quarter.
He was not very much surprised at discovering the
plain imprint of a shoe there in the soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George made it,&rdquo; said Giraffe solemnly, &ldquo;because
there&rsquo;s that old rag tied about his foot, as
we&rsquo;ve always found it. And, Thad, of course you
notice that he was heading up country when he
passed by here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s certainly a fact, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Showing he came down out of his tree, and went
on after we passed him. Davy was right when he
said he believed he could see signs in that last hemlock
as if some one had broken the bark with his
heels. It was Wandering George, all right; and
this time we&rsquo;ve got him ahead of us. We&rsquo;ll not let
him give us the slip again; and it&rsquo;ll be something
of a joke to get a tramp at each end of the island.
But what are you thinking about, Thad, to look so
serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering whether anything could have
happened to our two chums, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you must mean Bumpus and Smithy!&rdquo; ejaculated
the lanky scout, with a quick intake of his
breath, as though a thrill had passed over him at
the same time; &ldquo;but, Thad, they had a gun, you
remember; and if they kept on the watch, as you
told &rsquo;em, what could happen to hurt the boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, only it bothers me,&rdquo; replied the
other; &ldquo;and if we can hurry on any faster now I&rsquo;d
like to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word was passed along the line, and after
that they tried to increase their speed, though trying
not to neglect their work, if it could be avoided.</p>
<p>As they drew closer to the region where the camp
had been made, Thad was conscious of feeling a
strange sensation in the region of his heart, which
he could not wholly understand.</p>
<p>Giraffe made out to wander close to him on occasion,
and was at this time saying with more or less
confidence:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few minutes more, Thad, and we ought
to raise the camp. Sure we&rsquo;ll find everything
lovely, and the goose hanging high. George would
know better than to bother two fellows, and one
of the same handling a gun in the bargain. Course
he sheered off, and gave them a wide berth when
he saw that, Thad. It&rsquo;s going to come out all right,
I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless the patrol leader felt very anxious
as they drew near the camp, and he tried to prepare
himself for the worst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">THE KEEPERS OF THE CAMP.</span></h2>
<p>When Bumpus and Smithy saw their comrades
pass away toward the north, leaving the camp in
their full charge, they were immediately impressed
with a sense of great responsibility.</p>
<p>The stout scout in particular seemed to feel that
it was a post of honor to which they had been assigned
by the patrol leader. Of course this was
partly due to what Thad had told him at the time
he picked out the pair to remain behind and take
care of their few possessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be faithful and wide awake,
Smithy,&rdquo; Bumpus told his comrade; &ldquo;for it&rsquo;d be
a terrible calamity if the boys came back here, tired
and played out, only to find that the enemy had
captured the camp in their absence. And let me
tell you, that would reflect on you and me forever
and a day afterward. You know that Thad expects
every fellow to do his duty. So we&rsquo;ll keep on the
watch every minute of the time till they come back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Smithy appeared to be duly impressed with the
gravity of the occasion. Bumpus of course made
sure to carry the only weapon that had been left
in their charge; but as it was his gun, and he knew
more about handling it than Smithy did, it seemed
only right that this should be so. But the other
member of the home guard had seen some of the
boys who went off arming themselves with stout
cudgels, and he thought it wise to imitate their
example, though at the same time seriously doubting
his ability to make good use of the same, should
an emergency arise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what you say is true, Bumpus,&rdquo; he remarked
seriously. &ldquo;The motto of all good scouts
is &lsquo;Be prepared,&rsquo; and we must surely live up to it.
While I sincerely hope nothing will happen to call
for a defense of the camp, still I&rsquo;m ready to assume
my share of the burden in case of necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Smithy always liked to use long words,
and his manner was something like that of an important
pedagogue; but the boys had learned that
under all this surface veneering Smithy was true
gold, and, as Giraffe said, &ldquo;O. K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had never been the one to indulge in rough-and-tumble
&ldquo;horse play&rdquo; while in camp, like Giraffe,
Step Hen and Davy, for instance; but on several
occasions the others had seen his metal tested,
and Smithy had come out with flying colors.</p>
<p>His face might get white when danger impended,
but he had the right kind of nerve, and would stand
up for another, no matter what threatened. Smithy
was exceedingly modest, and always apologizing for
his lack of stamina; but Thad knew he was no coward
under it all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>The minutes passed slowly as the two boys sat
there by the cheery fire. Naturally they kept listening
eagerly, half expecting to hear some sudden wild
clamor that would announce the discovery of the
tramps, and a desperate effort on the part of their
chums to make them prisoners.</p>
<p>They remembered that these men were both big
fellows, and undoubtedly more or less to be feared,
especially when their passions were aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be anything doing so far,&rdquo; Bumpus
remarked, as he poked the fire, and immediately
afterward raised his head, as well as his fat neck
would allow, the better to listen intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d had sufficient time to
reach the upper end of the island, too?&rdquo; Smithy
went on to say reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, the real drive only begins then, you
see,&rdquo; Bumpus informed him, with rather an important
air. &ldquo;Thad said they meant to strike
straight for the place where we landed, and then
comb the ground as they came along. I don&rsquo;t just
know what he meant by that same word, but it
sounds good to me. When you comb a thing you
get everything out, even the tangles; and if the
tramps are hiding somewhere on the island they&rsquo;ll
be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust Thad for that,&rdquo; assented Smithy, who had
the greatest admiration for and confidence in the
scout master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was that moved then?&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus,
reaching out, and taking hold of his gun with
hands that trembled more or less, though at the
same time his teeth were grimly set, and his eyes
shone with determination. &ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; he added, after
a half minute of terrible suspense, &ldquo;look at that,
will you, only a sassy little striped chipmunk, after
all, frisking around to see if we hadn&rsquo;t spilled some
crumbs when we had our breakfast. But I&rsquo;m afraid
he&rsquo;ll be badly disappointed, because there ain&rsquo;t any
crumbs when you&rsquo;ve only had grits for your morning
meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they sat there for some little time
with senses on the alert, waiting for some sign
from the chums who had recently left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure,&rdquo; Bumpus finally remarked,
showing what was constantly on his mind; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve
just got to pass by this way sooner or later. Course
we&rsquo;ll see &rsquo;em then; and so don&rsquo;t be surprised if the
brush begins to move over yonder, because it&rsquo;ll be
one of our chums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t it be the proper caper for them
to warn us before they show up?&rdquo; asked Smithy.
&ldquo;They know you&rsquo;ve got a gun, and that&rsquo;s always a
dangerous toy for a boy to handle, according to my
way of thinking. Why, you might imagine they
were the tramps, and give them a shot before you
saw they were our chums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Bumpus, with a broad grin.</p>
<p>There came from amidst the thick brush a peculiar
sound that was supposed to resemble the
barking of a fox. Of course both guards recognized
it as the well-known signal with which members
of the Silver Fox Patrol made their presence
known to one another when in the forest, or in the
darkness of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Answer him, Bumpus,&rdquo; exclaimed Smithy, &ldquo;because
you can do it better than I&rsquo;ve ever been able
to. There he goes again, and louder than before.
It must be Giraffe, I should think. Let him know
we hear him, Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly the stout boy did his very best to
imitate the sharp little bark of a fox; it did not
matter whether red, black or gray, so long as the
sound carried out the idea intended.</p>
<p>At that a head arose above a line of brush, and
the smiling face of Giraffe was discovered. He
made a motion with his hand to indicate that he
and his five fellow scouts were headed south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No signs of &rsquo;em so far, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked Bumpus,
in a cautious tone; and in answer the other
shook his head in the negative, after which he once
more dropped out of sight, and doubtless moved
away on his mission.</p>
<p>The pair by the fire now prepared for quite a
long siege. They guessed that it would take the
others quite some time to cover the balance of the
island, although of course no one in the patrol
knew as yet just what the dimensions of their
strange prison might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing they run across George and his companion,
will they let us know of their good fortune?&rdquo;
Smithy asked, after a while, when nothing
came to their ears save the sound of the running
river and the cawing of the noisy crow band in the
tree tops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Bumpus told him, &ldquo;Thad promised
to send the news along if they were successful, and
bagged both hoboes. I keep hoping every minute
to get the call. You know, Smithy, lots of savage
people have a way of sending news by sound, and
by smoke, from one station to another. They say
in Africa they can get word over hundreds of miles
in less&rsquo;n no time. I&rsquo;m a great believer in that sort
of wireless telegraphy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked Smithy, with something approaching
humor, at least as near as he ever was
known to get to the joking stage, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that,
when you start to shouting for your supper, because
you can make the greatest racket going. But all the
same this thing of keeping camp while the rest of
the boys are on the move is rather prosy, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Thad assured me that any kind of a fellow
could just push through all that scramble of
brush; but it takes a different sort to be trusted
with the responsible task of guarding the home base.
He begged me not to think it meant any reflection
on our abilities, Smithy. Yes, he even called us the
hub of the wheel, of which each of the others was
only a spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That information rather bolstered up Smithy&rsquo;s
drooping spirits for a little while; but the solemn
stillness that surrounded them on all sides soon began
to make him drowsy again.</p>
<p>He had not secured his customary sleep latterly,
and the warmth of the fire assisted in causing his
eyes to become heavy.</p>
<p>Bumpus noticed this. Several times he talked to
his companion, with the sole idea of keeping Smithy
on the alert; but in the end he found that it did not
seem to avail to any extent, for the replies he received
were inclined to be hazy, as if the brain of
the other had begun to yield to that drowsy feeling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; Bumpus told himself, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
use bothering the poor tenderfoot? Smithy isn&rsquo;t
used to this, even if he is a pretty good fellow. He&rsquo;s
still mamma&rsquo;s darling boy more or less, and not
accustomed to roughing it, like the rest of us. He&rsquo;ll
learn in time, I reckon. Fortunately there&rsquo;s no
danger of <i>me</i> failing to stand the great test. Huh!
I&rsquo;ve been through the mill, I have, and proven my
worth more&rsquo;n once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same it seemed that despite his brave
words Bumpus also felt his eyes growing heavy
before long. Once he even aroused with a start,
as his head fell forward with a lurch, giving him a
little twinge in his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, this won&rsquo;t do, Bumpus Hawtree!&rdquo; he told
himself severely; &ldquo;you just get busy, and show what
a loyal, faithful scout you are. Want Thad to drop
in here, and find you sound asleep on your post, do
you? Well, that would be a nice pickle, believe me.
Smithy is only a poor tenderfoot at best, and not a
seasoned veteran. He might be excused, but what
would happen to you, tell me that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea seemed so monstrous that Bumpus immediately
scrambled to his feet, although his actions
did not seem to interfere at all with the peaceful
dreams of the sleeping scout. Smithy still sat
there, with his head bowed down on his breast, and
no doubt resting under the happy belief that he
was once more safe at home, after all this trying
flight along the flood-swept valley of the Susquehanna.</p>
<p>Bumpus walked away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>He thought he would feel more wide-awake if
he gave that fire the cold shoulder, and exercised
his benumbed limbs some. He took his gun, of
course, for Bumpus had learned a certain degree
of caution through his former experiences; and it
turned out to be a most fortunate thing he had that
sagacity.</p>
<p>After walking about for a little while Bumpus
settled down alongside a tree, and once more allowed
himself to think of a number of events connected
with the past, as well as his pleasant home,
now so far away.</p>
<p>He was aroused by what seemed to be the crackling
of a twig. This startled him, because his scout
training declared that such a sound must always be
accounted exceedingly suggestive.</p>
<p>Bumpus silently arose to his knees, and, gripping
his gun tightly in his fat hands, looked all around
him. A slight movement caught his attention. It
was directly toward the fire that he looked, and
what he saw thrilled him through and through.</p>
<p>A man was actually creeping forward on hands
and knees, stealing along with a manner suggestive
of a cat. Bumpus did not need to note the fact that
this party was wearing a blue army overcoat, now
muddy, and rather forlorn-looking, to realize that
it could be no other than the long-lost Wandering
George, the tramp whom they had trailed all the
way from far-distant Scranton.</p>
<p>That he had some evil design in approaching the
camp so secretly there could be no possible doubt.
Smithy was still dozing there, and would fall an
easy prey to the scheming tramp, unless some comrade
came boldly to the rescue. So Bumpus drew
in a long breath, clinched his teeth, and rising to
his feet moved forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">HEADED FOR HOME&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Just hold on there, George; you&rsquo;re under arrest!&rdquo;
Bumpus called out; and if his voice happened
to be a trifle shaky, the fact did not seem to
interfere with the clever way in which he swung
that gun up, so as to cover the tramp.</p>
<p>Smithy awoke, and was stunned at what he saw.
He sat there, turning his head, to stare first at the
figure clothed in the blue army coat, and then at
his comrade, seen just topping the bushes, and looking
so like he meant business. Smithy would long
remember that fine sight.</p>
<p>The hobo knew he was caught. Guns had a very
persuasive way with George, and he had learned
long ago to fight shy of all farmhouses where it was
known the owner possessed firearms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot, young feller!&rdquo; he immediately bellowed,
with astonishing energy; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter
try an&rsquo; git away. Say, I was jest a-wantin&rsquo; ter
surrender, so&rsquo;s ter git off&rsquo;n this island. I ain&rsquo;t never
yet starved ter death, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t wanter try the
same. I&rsquo;m a prisoner o&rsquo; war, an&rsquo; ye wouldn&rsquo;t be so
mean&rsquo;s as ter pepper a harmless man, I hopes, Boy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Bumpus proceeded to advance, all the while keeping
that menacing gun leveled. He had had a previous
experience in capturing a supposed-to-be desperate
rascal, and felt that he must be cautious in
how he handled matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smithy, is there a piece of that rope handy?&rdquo; he
demanded; and the other scout after a hasty look
around made an affirmative reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There certainly is, Bumpus, and it seems to be
a good strong piece, too,&rdquo; he went on to say.
&ldquo;Please tell me what you want me to do with it. I
know how to tie all sorts of perfectly splendid
knots; if only the wretch won&rsquo;t seize hold of me,
and make use of me as a shield. They&rsquo;re all so
very treacherous, you know, Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I understand that, Smithy,&rdquo; he was told,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m up to a trick or two on my own hook.
Here, you George, just drop down on your marrow
bones&mdash;that means get on your knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tramp looked anything but happy, but when
he hesitated Bumpus swung his gun up again, and
it could be easily seen that he was ready for business.
So George immediately dropped down on his
knees, with his hands still raised in a really grotesque
fashion above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t mean to ask you to say your
prayers, because I reckon you never learned any,&rdquo;
Bumpus proceeded briskly; &ldquo;but continue the forward
movement. In other words, fall flat on your
face, and stretch out there, with your nose rooting
in the ground. No back talk now, but do what
you&rsquo;re told!&rdquo;</p>
<p>George did so. He evidently knew better than
to refuse so modest a request, especially while
threatened with a load of shot at close quarters.</p>
<p>Then Bumpus advanced close up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Smithy,&rdquo; he said, with a grand air, as became
a conqueror, &ldquo;use your rope, and tie his wrists behind
his back. If there&rsquo;s enough left, give a turn
around his ankles, will you, please? And whatever
you do, let it be thorough. That&rsquo;s what scouts are
taught to always be, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the immediate eye of Bumpus the tramp
was triced up, after which the two boys dragged him
behind a screen of bushes. Bumpus was in constant
apprehension lest the second hobo appear on the
scene, and managed to keep his eyes turned this way
and that as the minutes passed on.</p>
<p>It seemed as though the morning must be wearing
away when finally the barking of a fox, so excellently
done that it would have deceived an old
hunter, announced the near presence of Allan and
Thad, and likely the others besides.</p>
<p>When they entered the camp they seemed to be
laboring under some excitement; but Bumpus had
warned Smithy not to give their secret away immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what luck did you have, boys?&rdquo; asked the
stout lad, as one and then another of the six filed
past him to the vicinity of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cornered one of the precious pair down at
the extreme end of the island,&rdquo; acknowledged Giraffe;
&ldquo;but George gave us the slip somehow. We
figured he must have hid in a hemlock top, and
after we passed come on up here; and since we ran
across his trail not far from camp some of us began
to get cold feet for fear that you two might
have been surprised and taken prisoner. We&rsquo;re all
as glad as hops to see that was a false alarm, Bumpus
and Smithy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But have you seen anything of George?&rdquo; asked
Thad, who believed there was something decidedly
odd about the way the features of the two guards
were working, as though they might be doing everything
in their power to conceal some secret.</p>
<p>Of course Bumpus had by that time reached the
limit of his endurance, especially since Smithy gave
a big yell, unable to hold in any further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and take a look back of the bushes there;
that&rsquo;s the answer, boys!&rdquo; Bumpus remarked, trying
to look indifferent, though really trembling all over
with the joyful excitement.</p>
<p>There was an immediate rush in the quarter
pointed out; and then shouts that might have easily
been heard at the lower end of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;ye think of that, now?&rdquo; Giraffe
was saying, in his usual boisterous manner; &ldquo;if they
haven&rsquo;t gone and done it, capturing the long-lost
George as nice as you please! Yes, and there&rsquo;s
that old engineer&rsquo;s army coat, too; mebbe the judge
won&rsquo;t be glad to get that keepsake back again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was especially well pleased. Of course this
was partly on account of having finally accomplished
the task that had been set before him, because
he always felt satisfied when he could look
back to duty well done.</p>
<p>Besides, he fairly gloried in the fact that the two
tenderfeet of the patrol, as they might still be
called, had succeeded in covering themselves with
honor in having captured the second desperate rascal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>The first thing Thad did was to stand the tramp
up, remove his bonds, and make him strip off the
blue coat that had once kept the judge&rsquo;s son warm
while serving Uncle Sam during our late war with
Spain, after which he saw to it that George had his
hands bound again.</p>
<p>Two of the boys were dispatched along the shore,
where the walking was better, to bring back the
other prisoner. To another pair was given the task
of setting up a pole on an elevated part of the
island, bearing a white flag, which, if seen by anyone
on the distant shore, might be the means of
bringing a boat to the rescue of the marooned ones.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Thad investigated, and found that
apparently George had had no suspicion that there
was anything sewed inside the red lining of the
army coat given to him by Mrs. Whittaker. Feeling
carefully along the sides, Thad discovered that
at a certain place there seemed to be something
nestled; and when he held the garment close to his
ear he was able to catch a slight rustling sound when
he bent it back and forth; so he concluded the paper
must be safe.</p>
<p>There was enough of the bacon and other things
left, it happened, to give them a scanty feed at
noon; and they had high hopes that before another
night came the conditions would be vastly improved.</p>
<p>This confidence proved well founded, for along
about three o&rsquo;clock Giraffe, who had set himself to
be the lookout, came running into camp with the
cheering news that two boats were coming from
the shore, and that the period of their captivity on
the island had reached its end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>It turned out that those rowing the boats were
men who had been sent out by the authorities to
look for any families in distress because of the flood
in the Susquehanna region. There was ample room
aboard for the eight scouts, as well as their two
prisoners; and in due time they landed on the bank,
overjoyed to know that not only were they free
once more, but that their principal object in making
this long hike had been handsomely accomplished.</p>
<p>Giraffe and Bumpus shook hands solemnly when
the fact was mentioned that they had been invited to
stay over at a neighboring farmhouse, where they
could obtain a bountiful supper and sleep in the
barn. That meant supreme happiness to the lengthy
and the stout members of the patrol, the &ldquo;fat and
the lean of it,&rdquo; as Giraffe himself would say.</p>
<p>Thad was careful to see that the two tramps were
handed over to the authorities. All the evidence
needed to convict them of the robbery of the Bailey
home was discovered on their persons, for they had
been tempted to take several little valuable bits of
jewelry that fastened the crime on them when found
in their pockets.</p>
<p>He felt that they were well rid of the rascals
when the two men were led away; nor did any of
the scouts ever set eyes on Wandering George or
his companion again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Since all of the patrol were exceedingly tired, it
can safely be assumed that they slept soundly on
that night. The hay was sweet; they had been
given a bountiful supper, such as only farmers&rsquo;
wives know how to spread before guests; and Bumpus
had done himself proud when called upon to
entertain their host&rsquo;s family with a number of favorite
songs, as well as by the dexterous use of his
bugle, upon which he dearly loved to play, and with
considerable effect.</p>
<p>When another day dawned the boys were given
a breakfast they would not soon forget, nor would
the kind lady accept a single cent in payment for
the same, declaring that she and her family had
enjoyed having the scouts remain a night with them,
and that they had learned a thousand things about
their work such as they had long been wishing to
know.</p>
<p>The homeward march was begun; and as time
was passing rapidly now, Thad thought it only right
they should take advantage of the fact that a trolley
covered a considerable number of miles between
Cranford and the point they were at. None of them
objected to this means of lightening their labors,
for several among the scouts had complained that
their feet were beginning to swell and pain them.</p>
<p>By clever work they managed to arrive home that
same evening, pleased with their last adventure.
Its successful termination would long be a source
of gratification to those who had participated in the
chase after Wandering George and the blue army
overcoat that the judge wanted to keep &ldquo;in memory
of his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad could not wait for morning to come, but
immediately after supper he took the coat, once
more brushed clean, over his arm, and set out for
the home of old Judge Whittaker. When he was
ushered into the library, and the eminent jurist saw
what he was carrying, he expressed himself pleased
in no uncertain tones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>As the good lady of the house happened to be
out at a neighbor&rsquo;s just then, the judge did not
hesitate to rip open the lining of the coat, and then
triumphantly extract a thin paper, which he seemed
to prize exceedingly.</p>
<p>He declared that he was under great obligations
to the scouts, and expressed an earnest desire to do
something grand for the troop; but of course Thad
was compelled to decline, assuring him they had enjoyed
the little adventure greatly, and that at any
rate the rules of their organization would prevent
them from accepting any pay for such a service.</p>
<p>Thad and his friends were looking forward to
another outing in the woods during the coming
summer, and expected to have a delightful time.
None of them, however, so much as suspected what
a strange turn of fortune would alter their plans,
and allow some of the scouts to visit foreign lands
while the greatest war in the history of the whole
world was breaking out. What wonderful things
happened to them abroad will be found recorded in
the next volume of this series, published under the
title of &ldquo;The Boy Scouts on the Rhine; or Under
Fire with the Allies.&rdquo;</p>
